&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;This is how a typical headline in global politics looks like when a jaw-dropping geopolitically motivated event occurs. At first glance, one might wonder why a country such as the US is so vested in the fund allocation of the North Korean treasury. It all essentially boils down to the degree of influence that a superpower (assumption being that the US is the lone superpower) has over nation states when it comes to their economy and people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The US does so in the larger interest of the world, and considers itself to be the saviour of our generation when it comes to averting a nuclear catastrophe. Since it cannot (and must not) threaten war on many already poverty stricken and poor states, it imposes a series of Keynesian tool-based economic sanctions that prohibit the economic growth of the nation state, as they directly affect the demand and supply chains of the economy and tend to cut them off from more states that are members of ‘the bloc’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The unsettling reality is that disasters similar to Hiroshima and Nagasaki continue to occur in Middle Eastern countries, where war has been raging for decades, and yet we've been so oblivious to their occurrences when we accidentally switch to &lt;em&gt;BBC International&lt;/em&gt; after cheering for our football team on the previous channel. But beneath the thick glorious boasts of killing ISIS leaders, annihilating Sanaa (again), and killing millions, there is the far more destructive layer of economic sanctions imposed on seemingly rogue states that disagree with the ideology of the world's leading nation state. The inconvenient reality is that those sanctions, in a roundabout way, have an effect on the health of citizens and frequently bring about devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Economic sanctions are of three types: (1) suspension of loans or aid withdrawal by the sender; (2) denial of access to international financial markets; and (3) bans on capital investment in the targeted state. They often involve a sector-specific ban such as an oil ban, textile ban, a ban on using a particular currency or engaging with particular financial operators (such as banks). Intended to impose constraints on the economic activities of the targeted state, economic sanctions aim to prevent a state from importing certain goods or services. They may also prevent a state from exporting its natural resources, agricultural, or manufactured products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Another type of economic sanction specifically targets the banking and financial sectors. Overseas assets, for example, can be frozen or transactions put on hold. Foreign aid may be withheld as well. Economic sanctions are most likely to be detrimental to a country. Refusing to import goods or services from a country can act as a kind of protectionist policy for the target country. This can create a constituency for such policies, making them difficult to repeal. A ban on exporting certain goods and services to a country, such as agricultural products, on the other hand, can harm influential sectors of the target country and make it difficult to impose or sustain such measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;According to Farrokh Habibzadeh's paper &lt;em&gt;Economic sanction: a weapon of mass destruction&lt;/em&gt;, the UN Security Council Resolution 661-3 imposed a multilateral sanction on Iraq in 1990, prohibiting the import of all substances other than those intended for scientific purposes, food, and various humanitarian items. The sanction killed approximately 1.5 million people (including more than half a million children) in Iraq - more than the number of people killed in Hiroshima in the aftermath of the nuclear bomb detonation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Many critical life-saving tablets become unavailable due to the imposition of sanctions. Even the production of a few drugs is reduced, if not halted, due to a scarcity of basic substances or spare device components required for drug production. The cost of medicines rises to a point that people with low incomes can only afford a small portion of it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;This results in growth of black markets as locations where medicines (occasionally forged) are illegally traded. Additionally, the lack of spare components tends to affect not only medical devices, but also different critical infrastructures such as electric powered generators. Consequently, frequent power outages result in severe problems such as lack of vaccines, tablets, ventilators, monitors, etc. Thus, hundreds of thousands of people die in silence as a result of diseases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;This quiet mass homicide in a tumultuous sector is not always noticed, and may even be overlooked. The same can be said about the current COVID crisis, in which the US refused to lift sanctions against Iran despite the fact that it was dealing with COVID-19 and low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Seen in this light, sanctions act as a terrifying mechanism for bringing a country to its knees. There are many ways to deal with 'rogue' states, but depriving people of their humanity is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shreyansh Verma</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">‘The United States has imposed severe sanctions over the state of North Korea for their new ballistic missile test.’ This is how a typical headline in global politics looks like when a jaw-dropping geopolitically motivated event occurs.

Apart from featuring multiple incredible songs with relatable lyrics like &lt;em&gt;Surface Pressure&lt;/em&gt;, the movie has numerous other factors working in its favour. One of them is the incorporation of 'heavy themes' like intergenerational trauma, neglect and so on. However, this isn’t the first time that Disney has successfully incorporated a more mature theme in a children’s movie. In fact, several other such animated movies, though severely underrated, exist and are a great watch for audiences of all ages because of their art, stories and themes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lilo &amp;amp; Stitch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;This movie is perhaps among the best animated movies to ever exist. It is a truly unique story about two Hawaiian orphans, the antisocial six-year-old Lilo Pelekai and her older sister, Nani. After the death of their parents in a car accident, Nani is forced to take up the responsibility of her sister, even though she herself is only a young adult. Lilo adopts Stitch, a genetically engineered alien that distantly resembles a blue koala. Released in 2002, the movie stands out among its contemporaries because of its storyline and themes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The Bechdel-Wallace test is a popular measure used to check for female representation in various productions. It is easy to pass the test: the production must have at least two female characters, who have names and converse with each other about anything but a man. Unfortunately, most movies fail this test even today. “Lilo and Stitch” stands out in this regard because not only does it pass the test, but also one of its central themes is the relationship between the two sisters. Such a theme was extremely rare back then and the scene hasn’t changed much since. There are some exceptions of course. Most notably, “Frozen” features two royal sisters- the first of its kind in the Disney princess lineup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Lilo is often misunderstood as a bratty child by the audience as she often misbehaves and lashes out at Nani. However, acting out is common in those who have had deeply traumatic experiences as the two sisters have. Unlike most Disney movies, where the character would most likely be grateful to the older sister, this is a more realistic depiction of the consequences of a tragedy. Lilo also articulates the reason for her anger: “I like you better as a sister than a mom&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;” and the realisation: “We’re a broken family, aren’t we?”. The story also explores their economic hardships and other struggles that come with their kind of family dynamic, including Nani trying to prove to a rightfully tough social worker named Cobra Bubbles that she is a responsible caregiver. At one point, even after giving Nani a chance to prove herself, Cobra Bubbles realises that Lilo is not safe in the household and that her sister is not a suitable guardian because of her temper and immaturity. The sisters come very close to separation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The art is yet another thing that deserves a lot of praise. Nani, unlike most animated young women, is dark-skinned, pug-nosed and has a curvy figure. Also, the story does not make a big deal out of this. That is to say, her not being pretty in terms of the West’s definition of the word is not a central theme and quite unlike most of its contemporary movies, there is no ugly duckling to swan transformation. She is strong and real, and certainly not a damsel in distress. We also get a glimpse of her budding romance with David, her coworker.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Another important theme is love and redemption. Lilo’s need for companionship and Stitch’s desire for a sense of belonging defines their relationship. Stitch was originally a mere experiment (Experiment 626) aimed to cause destruction. However, the love and kindness that Lilo shows helps Stitch make revelations about humanity and opt for a path of change. The film features some of the most iconic Disney dialogues including Lilo’s “Ohana means family, family means no one gets left behind or forgotten. But if you want to leave, you can. I'll remember you though. I remember everyone that leaves.” and Stitch’s “This is my family. I found it all on my own. It is little and broken but still good. Yeah…”. At the end of the movie, Stitch, Jumba and Pleakley become a part of Nani and Lilo’s family, relieving some of Nani’s burdens and creating a better environment for Lilo to grow up in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;A strong competition for the crown of the best animated film ever is &lt;em&gt;The Hunchback of the Notre Dame&lt;/em&gt; based on the Victor Hugo novel of the same name. Now, for those who have read the novel before, the title itself raises some red flags considering the fact that the movie is meant for children. An uninitiated child might not be able to notice the themes in play in the movie, but as an adult, watching it again, the messaging is clear and very important.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The story revolves around Claude Frollo, who is extremely prejudiced against gypsies. He calls them “sinful, invading gypsies” and is consumed by the desire to rid Paris of them, by any means necessary. Frollo’s abuse of power and rhetoric that aims to “other” the gipsies is one that we hear often even today, especially in the context of immigrants. Songs like “God Help the Outcasts” sung by the female protagonist and an outspoken gypsy woman, Esmeralda really leaves no space for doubt regarding what the story is about. She begs God, whom she confesses might not be the kind to pay heed to a meer gypsy’s prayer, to help her people, the “The poor and downtrodden”. She knows that there are those who are “Less lucky than I” and insists that God should help them because all of them, even though outcasts from society, are the “children of God”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Another victim of Frollo’s beliefs is the male protagonist Quasimodo. The film begins with Frollo pursuing some gypsies. Quasimodo’s mother is among them and she dies on the steps of the Notre Dame Cathedral during the pursuit. The Archdeacon, a clergyman of the cathedral, witnesses her death when he walks out to respond to her call for sanctuary. He is presented as a positive character, antithetical to Frollo’s character and ways. In the book, however, Frollo was the Archdeacon. Keeping it that way would have caused issues with the Church, which is probably why this change was made. The Archdeacon insists that Frollo take up the guardianship of Quasimodo to make up for his sin of killing his mother.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Quasi is physically deformed and his guardian is utterly repulsed by him. He is constantly told that he is a monster that even his own birth mother did not want, and that what little Frollo does for him is a great act of mercy. Quasi spends his life in the Notre Dame, hidden from everyone else, resenting the way he looks and with a job to ring the bells of the cathedral as required. His self-respect is severely damaged and he is left afraid of the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The story also provides a commentary on the mob mentality that results in Quasi’s public humiliation during the Festival of Fools and towards the end of the film, the burning of the city of Paris. Much like Esmeralda, Quasi is an outcast looking for a sense of safety and belonging. However, not only does she not see the reason to make him an outcast because of his looks, Esmeralda stands up for him during the Festival of Fools. These are among the reasons that he falls for her. However, Esmeralda falls in love with Phoebus. At the end of the movie, we see Quasimodo accept the fact that Esmeralda is in love with someone else (which is in contrast with Frollo’s actions, as discussed in the following paragraphs). It is common to have characters in a similar situation take this as a challenge and pursue the woman relentlessly or get mad at the world for being “friend-zoned”. This protagonist, on the other hand, takes a more realistic and healthy approach to the situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The most shocking aspect of the film is the representation of Judge Frollo as a lascivious character. It is his lust for Esmeralda that makes him burn down Paris. In one scene, he sniffs her hair and the following exchange takes place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Esmeralda: &quot;What are you doing?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Frollo: &quot;I was just imagining a rope around your neck&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Esmeralda: &quot;I know what you were imagining!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Frollo even blames her for pushing him to commit a sin in his song &lt;em&gt;Hellfire&lt;/em&gt; (the lyrics showcasing Frollo’s lust for Esmeralda is in stark contrast with the lyrics of &lt;em&gt;Heaven’s Light&lt;/em&gt; that Quasimodo sings moments prior, confessing his love for Esmeralda). The lyrics go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Like fire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Hellfire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;This fire in my skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;This burning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Desire&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Is turning me to sin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;It's not my fault&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Mea culpa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;I'm not to blame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Mea culpa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is the gypsy girl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The witch who set this flame&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Mea maxima culpa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;It’s not my fault&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Mea culpa)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;It in God’s plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Mea culpa)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;He made the devil so much stronger than a man&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;'Mea Culpa' translates to 'my fault'. You can literally see him arguing with himself- whether he wants an answer from Beata Maria (Virgin Mary) or Hell’s fire (he spends most of the time looking at and addressing the fire). Unlike other Disney villains, he is not having the time of his life, he is conflicted. The song is accompanied by some of the darkest visuals and symbolism to exist in any Disney movie: of hellfire and Esmeralda dancing provocatively in the fire. He wants her to be “mine and mine alone” and towards the end of the scene he gives her an ultimatum:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Now gypsy, it's your turn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Choose me or&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Your pyre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Be mine or you will burn&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Kyrie Eleison)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;God have mercy on her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Kyrie Eleison)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;God have mercy on me&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;(Kyrie Eleison)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;But she will be mine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;or she will burn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Frollo is probably the only Disney villain which can and has existed in the past in real life. This only makes him scarier. So, if you did not enjoy the movie as a kid, it's time to watch it again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;There are, of course, several other Disney animated movies that are very sophisticated in the themes that they present: &lt;em&gt;Big Hero 6&lt;/em&gt; talks about depression caused by loss, &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; talks about misogyny, &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; talks about fear-mongering and othering, &lt;em&gt;Lion King&lt;/em&gt; talks about familial betrayal, &lt;em&gt;Coco&lt;/em&gt; talks about death, betrayal and familial love, and so on and so forth. These themes make the movies, not only fun for people of all ages to watch, but also introspective and educational, especially for a slightly older audience than the one we usually associate with 'cartoons'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Oindrila Ghosh</name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">Disney’s Encanto has been the talk of the town for several months now.

He is presented as a positive character, antithetical to Frollo’s character and ways. In the book, however, Frollo was the Archdeacon. Keeping it that way would have caused issues with the Church, which is probably why this change was made. The Archdeacon insists that Frollo take up the guardianship of Quasimodo to make up for his sin of killing his mother.&amp;nbsp; Quasi is physically deformed and his guardian is utterly repulsed by him. He is constantly told that he is a monster that even his own birth mother did not want, and that what little Frollo does for him is a great act of mercy. Quasi spends his life in the Notre Dame, hidden from everyone else, resenting the way he looks and with a job to ring the bells of the cathedral as required. His self-respect is severely damaged and he is left afraid of the world.&amp;nbsp; The story also provides a commentary on the mob mentality that results in Quasi’s public humiliation during the Festival of Fools and towards the end of the film, the burning of the city of Paris. Much like Esmeralda, Quasi is an outcast looking for a sense of safety and belonging. However, not only does she not see the reason to make him an outcast because of his looks, Esmeralda stands up for him during the Festival of Fools. These are among the reasons that he falls for her. However, Esmeralda falls in love with Phoebus. At the end of the movie, we see Quasimodo accept the fact that Esmeralda is in love with someone else (which is in contrast with Frollo’s actions, as discussed in the following paragraphs). It is common to have characters in a similar situation take this as a challenge and pursue the woman relentlessly or get mad at the world for being “friend-zoned”. This protagonist, on the other hand, takes a more realistic and healthy approach to the situation.&amp;nbsp; The most shocking aspect of the film is the representation of Judge Frollo as a lascivious character. It is his lust for Esmeralda that makes him burn down Paris. In one scene, he sniffs her hair and the following exchange takes place: Esmeralda: &quot;What are you doing?&quot;Frollo: &quot;I was just imagining a rope around your neck&quot;Esmeralda: &quot;I know what you were imagining!&quot; Frollo even blames her for pushing him to commit a sin in his song Hellfire (the lyrics showcasing Frollo’s lust for Esmeralda is in stark contrast with the lyrics of Heaven’s Light that Quasimodo sings moments prior, confessing his love for Esmeralda). The lyrics go: Like fireHellfireThis fire in my skinThis burningDesireIs turning me to sinIt's not my fault(Mea culpa)I'm not to blame(Mea culpa)It is the gypsy girlThe witch who set this flame(Mea maxima culpa)It’s not my fault(Mea culpa)It in God’s plan(Mea culpa) He made the devil so much stronger than a man 'Mea Culpa' translates to 'my fault'. You can literally see him arguing with himself- whether he wants an answer from Beata Maria (Virgin Mary) or Hell’s fire (he spends most of the time looking at and addressing the fire). Unlike other Disney villains, he is not having the time of his life, he is conflicted. The song is accompanied by some of the darkest visuals and symbolism to exist in any Disney movie: of hellfire and Esmeralda dancing provocatively in the fire. He wants her to be “mine and mine alone” and towards the end of the scene he gives her an ultimatum: Now gypsy, it's your turnChoose me orYour pyreBe mine or you will burn(Kyrie Eleison)God have mercy on her(Kyrie Eleison)God have mercy on me(Kyrie Eleison)But she will be mineor she will burn! Frollo is probably the only Disney villain which can and has existed in the past in real life. This only makes him scarier. So, if you did not enjoy the movie as a kid, it's time to watch it again.&amp;nbsp; There are, of course, several other Disney animated movies that are very sophisticated in the themes that they present: Big Hero 6 talks about depression caused by loss, Mulan talks about misogyny, Luca talks about fear-mongering and othering, Lion King talks about familial betrayal, Coco talks about death, betrayal and familial love, and so on and so forth. These themes make the movies, not only fun for people of all ages to watch, but also introspective and educational, especially for a slightly older audience than the one we usually associate with 'cartoons'.&amp;nbsp;</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Policy Framework for Effective Immunization Coverage of the Indian Population</title><link href="/A-Policy-Framework-for-Effective-Immunization-Coverage-of-the-Indian-Population" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Policy Framework for Effective Immunization Coverage of the Indian Population" /><published>2022-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/A-Policy-Framework-for-Effective-Immunization-Coverage-of-the-Indian-Population</id><content type="html" xml:base="/A-Policy-Framework-for-Effective-Immunization-Coverage-of-the-Indian-Population">&lt;p&gt;Despite the widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines, disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases continue to occur due to poor coverage at all ages, especially in times of COVID-19. Immunization is the most cost-effective way that prevents suffering through sickness, disability and death. India has made significant progress on sustainable and inclusive growth in the past three decades. There is now a greater sense of awareness and expectations from the citizens as the country makes further social and economic progress. But still, there exist significant inequities in vaccination coverage across states based on various factors related to the individual (gender, birth order), family (area of residence, wealth, and parental education), demography structure (religion, caste) and community (access to health care, community literacy level) characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasons for Low Immunization Coverage&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to multiple reasons, overall immunization coverage levels are low in India. According to the National Coverage Evaluation Survey of 2009, the reasons for low immunization coverage pertain to issues on the demand and supply side (as given in the figure below). Formative research carried out in 2015 in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu showed that parents lacked awareness and did not understand the role of immunization in preventing diseases. The perceived threat of vaccine-preventable diseases was overall low. Lack of knowledge of the immunization schedule (the what, when and why), lack of urgency, and prioritization of vaccination are responsible for the low service demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-center&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;assets/images/2022-02-27-A-Policy-Framework-for-Effective-Immunization-Coverage-of-the-Indian-Population-image1.png&quot; /&gt;Figure 1: Reasons for low immunization coverage in India (Source: UNICEF CES 2009)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addressing Immunization Coverage Gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In remote areas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Planning predictable outreach services&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leveraging new innovations in supply chain and mapping technology&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conducting multi-sectoral engagement to address transport challenges&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Designing appropriate service delivery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In urban areas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mapping the urban unimmunized and their numbers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overcoming legal obstacles&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deciding fixed service delivery schedules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Align and coordinate between overlapping governance systems&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use of innovative data to better account for urban mobility&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engage strategically with private health care providers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and expand mechanisms for registration and reminders, including harnessing the potential of new technology and mobile systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conflict-affected/insecure areas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Engaging With non-traditional partners&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Security assessments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close community engagement&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coordination with other humanitarian relief activities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility around vaccine scheduling and dosing options&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoting&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;fixed-day, fixed time, and fixed-site strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is effective in delivering immunisation services to ensure that communities are aware of the immunisation day. Anganwadi centres, schools, panchayat grounds and dispensaries can better serve as immunisation sites. Specific days can be fixed for each month as Village Health and Nutrition Days to maximise the opportunity for community mobilisation and service delivery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraging&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;catch-up campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for all interrupted vaccine schedules (adolescent, college, travel, adults and the elderly), is the need of the hour. Similarly, intensified campaigns for boosting coverage in low performing areas and vulnerable populations need to be implemented. This will be beneficial in increasing demand and building vaccine confidence through communication strategy and stress on preventive health care than curative to prevent the spread of diseases, especially COVID these days.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immunisation sessions&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;may be held with flexible timings. Their reach can be expanded through mobile sessions and mobilisation by other departments. An online portal can be used for timely reporting and supervision.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Performance incentives&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for achievement in immunisation coverage at household, panchayat, block, district and state levels can be given. Promotion of inter-sectoral synergies between organisations, communities and individuals on spreading immunisation. &lt;strong&gt;Strengthening collaborations&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with ministries, educational bodies, and NGOs need to be taken up to transform the public perceptions and attitudes and to mobilise human and available platforms for immunisation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuous&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;skill-building of health workers&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;associated with routine immunisation programs is required to achieve and sustain quality coverage of immunisation. Training modules for front line health workers, medical officers, cold chain and vaccine supply staff need to be prepared and updated periodically to train the staff.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School health programs&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;need to be stressed as well. The ANMs and other frontline workers’ visits to schools should be mandated at least once a year with vaccines to assess the immunisation status of children. Use of Due List by frontline health workers for tracking beneficiaries is needed and improvement of communication with parents is important to reduce dropouts, which can take place during Parent-Teacher Meetings (PTMs).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing demand and reducing barriers for people to access immunisation services can be very effectively done through improved&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;social mobility&lt;/strong&gt;. ASHA driven mechanisms, such as the mother’s meetings, need to be utilised to promote immunisation messages, discuss how children become vulnerable to diseases, and the various risks involved with lower child immunity. It can educate them on the importance of routine immunisation. Recognising the critical role men play in immunisation decision making and uptake is important. New platforms can be created, such as father’s meetings, to sensitize and orient men on these issues as well. Community and religious male influencers need to be identified to support frontline workers in reaching out to hesitant/resistant male members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensuring&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;adequate funds&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;for communication interventions and activities related to immunisation programs is needed. The available funds can be supplied to dispensaries or government hospitals that can be used by Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers and ANM for these communication efforts and to avoid temporary cash flow issues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community members, NGOs and interest groups in immunisation like&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;women’s self-help groups&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;should be involved in advocacy for implementation and increasing demand for services. Where-ever the reports of mistrust towards immunisation by community members are noticed, these should be studied and appropriate corrective actions need to be taken. &lt;strong&gt;New communication material&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;on immunisation should be developed and disseminated widely. New audio-visual communication messages for TV and radio, along with print material needs to be developed. The government can also use social media platforms as a parallel communication channel to increase visibility with multiple target audiences. Institutions like NSS, NCC, etc., can also be mobilised to reach out to school youth and eligible children in hard-to-reach population areas to spread awareness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High quality and timely&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;immunisation data&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are vital for immunisation tracking to make informed decisions at local, national, and global levels about better reach. The introduction of new vaccines, documenting and monitoring the impact, and improving the immunisation systems performance by prioritising resources and activities should be of utmost importance. The use of technology for tracking the beneficiaries is extremely helpful. Application-based records, instead of or along with the immunisation cards will help in tracking the number of children, females and other age group people vaccinated at a given point in time. The data will be sent directly to the Department/ ministry that can track the progress and form reports to address the lagging issues and areas. This also solves frontline workers’ issues as their performance will be tracked alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccination Tracking System&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;should be used to help reduce the gap between reported and evaluated coverage of vaccines. It has to be designed to collate information of all pregnant women and infants into a central database and the database will enable functions like data analysis, report generation, and thus, will contribute to better decision-making and timely and effective allocation of resources. It will act as a feedback system for health workers like nurses, midwives, ASHAs, etc., and will enable better health service delivery by drawing out action plans for health workers for antenatal care, prenatal care and child immunisation. Under this system, SMS alerts and phone calls can also be made to pregnant women, who are nearing the delivery date to remind them of the need to visit the health care centre for prenatal check-up and delivery, and to mothers about their child’s immunisation due dates. Audio-video counselling can also be done using the system to support immunisation activities and create awareness.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New technologies&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Blockchain can be used track all products in the supply chain and gather data about each product through innovative and cost effective methods. This kind of access to data helps in ensuring proper distribution, prediction of the demand and supply levels, and reducing the cost and wastage of all limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governments must reduce access barriers to vaccines and vaccination to recover from the negative impacts of the pandemic on routine vaccination coverage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccine delivery channels&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;can be expanded to include pharmacy-based, community-based, employer-based, residential-care-based, and school-based delivery of vaccinations, to support successful implementation of life-course immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach is no longer appropriate in this changing world. The diverse dynamics must be addressed at sub-national levels to achieve better immunisation coverage. Immunisation programmes require continued nurturing and attention to remain as a resilient service delivery platform for primary health care and to take advantage of and harness new technologies to reach unimmunised children in the remotest parts of the country.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Swati Solanki</name></author><category term="policy" /><summary type="html">Despite the widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines, disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases continue to occur due to poor coverage at all ages, especially in times of COVID-19.

However, it was also responsible for facilitating the first financial bubble in history, namely, the ‘Dutch tulip bulb market bubble’. It happened in Holland during the early 1600’s when speculation drove the value of tulip bulbs to extremes. At the market’s peak, the rarest tulip bulbs were traded for as much as six times the average person's annual salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Tulips first arrived in Western Europe from native Turkey in the late 1500’s. Initially purchased as a status symbol by the wealthy, they attracted the attention of the middle class. In 1634, tulip mania swept through Holland. Charles Mackay stated: &quot;The rage among the Dutch to possess (tulip bulbs) was so great that the ordinary industry of the country was neglected, and the population, even to its lowest dregs, embarked in the tulip trade.&quot; According to McKay, a single bulb could be worth as much as 4,000 or even 5,500 florins. In today's monetary terms, the best tulips would cost upwards of $750,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;By 1636, the demand for the tulip trade was so high that regular marts for their sale were established on the Stock Exchange of Amsterdam, in Rotterdam, Haarlem, and other towns. Professional traders joined in at that time, and everyone seemed to be making money just by purchasing these rare bulbs. The price of tulips seemed to only go up. People began buying tulips with leverage, using derivatives contracts to acquire more than they could afford. Despite the promising start, confidence got quickly shattered.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;By the end of the year 1637, prices began to decline and then never really went up. The rapid decline was largely caused by people purchasing bulbs on credit in the hope of repaying their loans when they sold them for a profit. As prices fell, the bulb holders were forced to liquidate and declare bankruptcy.&amp;nbsp; By 1638, tulip bulb prices had crashed, returning to the price levels they had once commanded upon their arrival in Holland. As a result of the Dutch tulip mania, the economy slowed down in the Dutch Golden Age. As the prices fell, demand decreased along with household spending, resulting in a shrinking economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, the actual impact of the incident is often questioned by cynics. Irrespective of the scale of the event, it does teach us an important lesson in investing: be wary of financial bubbles. Bubbles occur when market value erupts rapidly, particularly in the price of assets. Following this rapid inflation, a subsequent contraction occurs. A bubble usually forms when asset prices surge due to exuberant market behaviour. During a bubble, assets typically trade at prices that exceed their intrinsic value by a significant margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Several such economic bubbles have occurred throughout history, such as the South Sea Bubble of 1720, Japan's Asset Price Bubble of the 1980's, the Dotcom bubble, and the 2008 US Housing Bubble. These are some of history's largest financial bubbles, but in recent times, Michael Hartnett, Chief Investment Strategist at Bank of America, has dubbed Bitcoin &quot;the mother of all bubbles.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The scenario around Bitcoin has almost all of the signs of a financial bubble. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and took two years to reach the price of $1 in February, 2011. However, ten years later, in 2021, at one point it was worth just under $45,000. Hence, it has grown a staggering 45,000 times in ten years, a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 191.16%.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Even now, when Bitcoin has become culturally mainstream, it continues to be volatile. It doubled investors’ wealth in 2020, but it also halved in 30 days from mid-April to mid-May in 2021. These fluctuations have started to have major impacts on conventional markets such as the stock markets. Bitcoin reached a market cap of over $1 trillion in May of 2021, which is more than the combined market cap of Visa and JPMorgan. Due to its sheer size and the amount of money tied up in this cryptocurrency, when the bubble bursts and Bitcoin hits near-zero, it will be the 'mother of all financial bubbles'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Besides the inexplicable astronomical rise in value, there are numerous other indicators that point to Bitcoin being a quintessential financial bubble. Bitcoin has been labelled as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics namely, Paul Krugman, Robert J Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, Richard Thaler, James Heckman, Thomas Sargent, Angus Deaton, and Oliver Hart. While these economists have discussed a variety of issues concerning Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, the following are the primary reasons for classifying it as a speculative bubble:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of Intrinsic Value:&lt;/em&gt; While fiat currencies, which have been in use for as long as one can remember, have no intrinsic value and are backed by faith in the government, they work as a store of value because they can be used to trade almost anywhere and anytime. Furthermore, fluctuations in these currencies are effectively monitored by governments in order to avoid excessive volatility and protect people from unwarranted losses. It is in this regard that Bitcoin completely fails. According to Maddie Shepherd of Fundera, out of an estimated 582 million entrepreneurs in the world, only 15,174 businesses accept Bitcoin as of December 2020. Since it is not an effective medium of exchange, it also fails as a real store of value since it lacks real utility. Furthermore, its volatility is another reason why it is not a reliable store of value. As a result, it is not a real asset and has no intrinsic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Susceptibility to market manipulation: &lt;/em&gt;Bitcoin has been artificially driven by tweets from eminent personalities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, demonstrating how fickle this market is. The Tesla boss initially supported Bitcoin. In February, he purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin for Tesla's balance sheet, and a month later, he announced that the company would begin accepting Bitcoin for electric vehicle purchases. After 49 days, he tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin due to the adverse environmental impact of mining it and subsequently turned his attention to Dogecoin. Thus, tweets with little or no substance are creating and erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in Bitcoin market value. This is a clear indication that a bubble has been brewing for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Price is driven by momentum and attention from retail investors: &lt;/em&gt;Two factors that are behind the soaring price of Bitcoin are momentum and the attention that people pay to it. Momentum means that if Bitcoin goes up more than usual, it will, on average, continue to rise. The fear of missing out on this supposed ‘get rich quick scheme’ keeps the prices high. Similarly, if there are more Google searches for the word Bitcoin, for example, Bitcoin prices tend to go up. Hence, a large proportion of Bitcoin's gains are due to hype, as Bitcoin seems to be at the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ phase on Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Another noteworthy point is that there are no readily identifiable real-world correlations. For example, it is well-known that gold and the US dollar have an inverse relationship. When the dollar is declining in value, gold is likely rising in value. This is a correlation that's been established over a long period. Enthusiasts have pointed out how Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation, but they forget that Bitcoin has both risen and fallen when the money supply expanded rapidly or slowly. Cryptocurrency is driven by emotion and technical analysis, primarily because it has no real-world correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Due to its monumental returns and growing popularity, Bitcoin has gone from being a relatively small niche of the tech industry to a cheat code for institutional investors to boost fund returns at the expense of ignorant retail investors. While the arrival of these investors triggers a spurt in prices, it also marks the beginning of the end for most financial bubbles. There is very little contrast between the Tulip Mania of 400 years ago and the current Bitcoin situation. Both started insignificantly, only to become public frenzies very soon. And in the pursuit of making an easy profit, the Tulip Bulbs imploded, which points to what is inevitably coming for Bitcoin. The bubble will eventually burst.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Raghav Dhariwal</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">The Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX), regarded as the predecessor of contemporary investing, paved the way for modern stock exchanges. However, it was also responsible for facilitating the first financial bubble in history, namely, the ‘Dutch tulip bulb market bubble’. It happened in Holland during the early 1600’s when speculation drove the value of tulip bulbs to extremes. At the market’s peak, the rarest tulip bulbs were traded for as much as six times the average person's annual salary. Tulips first arrived in Western Europe from native Turkey in the late 1500’s. Initially purchased as a status symbol by the wealthy, they attracted the attention of the middle class. In 1634, tulip mania swept through Holland. Charles Mackay stated: &quot;The rage among the Dutch to possess (tulip bulbs) was so great that the ordinary industry of the country was neglected, and the population, even to its lowest dregs, embarked in the tulip trade.&quot; According to McKay, a single bulb could be worth as much as 4,000 or even 5,500 florins. In today's monetary terms, the best tulips would cost upwards of $750,000. By 1636, the demand for the tulip trade was so high that regular marts for their sale were established on the Stock Exchange of Amsterdam, in Rotterdam, Haarlem, and other towns. Professional traders joined in at that time, and everyone seemed to be making money just by purchasing these rare bulbs. The price of tulips seemed to only go up. People began buying tulips with leverage, using derivatives contracts to acquire more than they could afford. Despite the promising start, confidence got quickly shattered.&amp;nbsp; By the end of the year 1637, prices began to decline and then never really went up. The rapid decline was largely caused by people purchasing bulbs on credit in the hope of repaying their loans when they sold them for a profit. As prices fell, the bulb holders were forced to liquidate and declare bankruptcy.&amp;nbsp; By 1638, tulip bulb prices had crashed, returning to the price levels they had once commanded upon their arrival in Holland. As a result of the Dutch tulip mania, the economy slowed down in the Dutch Golden Age. As the prices fell, demand decreased along with household spending, resulting in a shrinking economy. However, the actual impact of the incident is often questioned by cynics. Irrespective of the scale of the event, it does teach us an important lesson in investing: be wary of financial bubbles. Bubbles occur when market value erupts rapidly, particularly in the price of assets. Following this rapid inflation, a subsequent contraction occurs. A bubble usually forms when asset prices surge due to exuberant market behaviour. During a bubble, assets typically trade at prices that exceed their intrinsic value by a significant margin. Several such economic bubbles have occurred throughout history, such as the South Sea Bubble of 1720, Japan's Asset Price Bubble of the 1980's, the Dotcom bubble, and the 2008 US Housing Bubble. These are some of history's largest financial bubbles, but in recent times, Michael Hartnett, Chief Investment Strategist at Bank of America, has dubbed Bitcoin &quot;the mother of all bubbles.&quot; The scenario around Bitcoin has almost all of the signs of a financial bubble. Bitcoin was launched in 2009 and took two years to reach the price of $1 in February, 2011. However, ten years later, in 2021, at one point it was worth just under $45,000. Hence, it has grown a staggering 45,000 times in ten years, a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 191.16%.&amp;nbsp; Even now, when Bitcoin has become culturally mainstream, it continues to be volatile. It doubled investors’ wealth in 2020, but it also halved in 30 days from mid-April to mid-May in 2021. These fluctuations have started to have major impacts on conventional markets such as the stock markets. Bitcoin reached a market cap of over $1 trillion in May of 2021, which is more than the combined market cap of Visa and JPMorgan. Due to its sheer size and the amount of money tied up in this cryptocurrency, when the bubble bursts and Bitcoin hits near-zero, it will be the 'mother of all financial bubbles'. Besides the inexplicable astronomical rise in value, there are numerous other indicators that point to Bitcoin being a quintessential financial bubble. Bitcoin has been labelled as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics namely, Paul Krugman, Robert J Shiller, Joseph Stiglitz, Richard Thaler, James Heckman, Thomas Sargent, Angus Deaton, and Oliver Hart. While these economists have discussed a variety of issues concerning Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, the following are the primary reasons for classifying it as a speculative bubble: Lack of Intrinsic Value: While fiat currencies, which have been in use for as long as one can remember, have no intrinsic value and are backed by faith in the government, they work as a store of value because they can be used to trade almost anywhere and anytime. Furthermore, fluctuations in these currencies are effectively monitored by governments in order to avoid excessive volatility and protect people from unwarranted losses. It is in this regard that Bitcoin completely fails. According to Maddie Shepherd of Fundera, out of an estimated 582 million entrepreneurs in the world, only 15,174 businesses accept Bitcoin as of December 2020. Since it is not an effective medium of exchange, it also fails as a real store of value since it lacks real utility. Furthermore, its volatility is another reason why it is not a reliable store of value. As a result, it is not a real asset and has no intrinsic value. Susceptibility to market manipulation: Bitcoin has been artificially driven by tweets from eminent personalities such as Tesla CEO Elon Musk, demonstrating how fickle this market is. The Tesla boss initially supported Bitcoin. In February, he purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin for Tesla's balance sheet, and a month later, he announced that the company would begin accepting Bitcoin for electric vehicle purchases. After 49 days, he tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin due to the adverse environmental impact of mining it and subsequently turned his attention to Dogecoin. Thus, tweets with little or no substance are creating and erasing hundreds of billions of dollars in Bitcoin market value. This is a clear indication that a bubble has been brewing for some time. Price is driven by momentum and attention from retail investors: Two factors that are behind the soaring price of Bitcoin are momentum and the attention that people pay to it. Momentum means that if Bitcoin goes up more than usual, it will, on average, continue to rise. The fear of missing out on this supposed ‘get rich quick scheme’ keeps the prices high.

Alas, what is far from amusing is the grand display of economic and social disparity in the country. While visuals of people relishing and gratifying their taste buds over mouth-watering delicacies is highly marketed (especially in the urban cities), it stands as a vivid contrast to the number of people (encompassing within itself a rather copious percentage of children) begging for food and sustenance. This reality is truly appalling. The visuals that fail to leave the conscious heart of a human being is the reality of seeing people picking up food from bins and heaps of garbage in the diluted will to keep themselves alive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The inadequacies of food security throughout the globe have been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected people across borders. However, that apart, the goal of zero hunger in terms of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, already seemed far from realisation prior to the pandemic due to a lethal blend of conflict, climate change, natural disasters, and structural poverty and inequality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;There is little doubt about the fact that food in its nutritious balance is the answer to solving hunger. As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen holistically characterises the issue, food security ought to be “well thought out in terms of delivery and food choice”. Through the course of this article, I explore how the facets explored by Dr Sen can be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;In regards to food choice, it is advisable to take note of the good work of Dr Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize from Bangladesh. Dr Yunus partnered with Danone, the multinational food company, in a joint venture to produce yogurt enriched with micronutrients at an&amp;nbsp;affordable price. He came up with a small bowl of yoghurt that could supplement all the essential nutrients required by the human body, at a very minimum cost, so that it could be made available even at the ground level. This example of Dr Yunus’ work highlights how food choice is not merely about choosing a combination of foodtypes alone, but of deploying science and technology to produce foodstuffs that deliver optimum nutrition without having to procure and distribute tons of grain, meat, fruit and vegetables.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;But of course, optimal nutrition is one thing, while delivery of the same is another. India, on paper, does have a brilliant food security programme, which aims to provide food grains to two-thirds of its 1.3 billion strong population. It has a massive Midday Meal Scheme which seeks to provide nutrition-rich meals to children in public schools. But the reality is that India ranked 94 out of 107 countries in the Global Hunger Index. More than 14% of the world's undernourished children under the age of five are found in India, and 34.7% of the world's stunted children under that age are also found in this country. Clearly, the delivery of food security in the country has been totally bungled up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;However, where the government’s are failing, it would seem the private sector gives a glimmer of hope. At a time when most governments were in an impotent situation with the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020, private actors and various NGOs made an attempt to bridge the gap. With many families at the mercy of the authorities and rations for their sustenance, with schools closed and no access to mid-day meals, these stakeholders came to their rescue. A project named &lt;em&gt;‘&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shakti Annadanam’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(Strength through food donations) launched by Indian actor Sonu Sood fed more than 45,000 people on a daily basis in Mumbai and its adjoining areas. A District and Sessions Judge B Papi Reddy had started free food distribution for the needy at the Government Hospital in his district. White Globe NGO's 'Food for All' drive started after they received a large number of queries from needy people post the lockdown extension in India in 2020. The NGO`s campaign had been successful in helping a lot of families in Srinagar, Kashmir. These are just a few out of many such initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;What these instances exemplify for us is that the State and its organs alone cannot be responsible for ensuring 100% realisation of food security in the country or across the globe. It is time for private actors and corporations to step in with an initiative. Considering private wealth is seldom transferred with the goal of enhancing food security, it is quintessential to focus&amp;nbsp;activities of different actors in the private sector in order to assess the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) approach's efficacy in furtherance of food and social security.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Private initiative must continue to be a source of support for government action. In every case, it demonstrates the need for legal food security control. Both the public and commercial sectors must adjust their mentality in order to actively engage in enhancing the food security chain. Accountability is required of&amp;nbsp;decision-makers, including private actors which affect the society in ways innumerable.&amp;nbsp;On a global scale, inspiration should be drawn from initiatives like The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition that fosters public–private partnership and provides financial and technical support for large-scale food security and nutrition projects. Malnutrition can be actively reduced via such novel methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Actions in the direction of strengthening agricultural value chains and assisting farmers in improving their livelihoods, like the programme initiated by Nestle is a welcome change. The result is securing access to land, better financial services, technology for market access and improving yields – all of which would help the farmers earn more money. The community also benefits from a steady and local supply. To combat logistical issues due to the vastness of the population, a key strategy is to ensure that supply systems are in place to get food to people who need it most. Apart from focusing CSR activities on food security, companies must also ensure to support the local community in providing food that comes from excess. Initiating employee incentive schemes to make sure every single stakeholder in the company contributes his/her/zer bit at the smallest level, can go a long way. Shareholders of the companies must also play an active role in making sure to support companies who espouse such initiatives and reforms at various levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Lastly, while the situation is grim, progress has definitely been made. It is time for greater cooperation and implementation among stakeholders. Much like the definition of food security, the implementation of the same as to be holistic as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aurin Chakraborty</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="policy" /><category term="humanity" /><summary type="html">As a young student pursuing his undergraduate studies in Delhi, traversing the lanes of Jama Masjid, Chandni Chowk and places alike, which comprise the food havens of India, is always a dream.

Launched in 2009 as a brainchild of Chinese designer Jiang Qiong Er, its products including apparel, furniture, and leather goods, reflect a contemporary twist on Chinese aesthetics and crafts. They are designed to bridge the burgeoning nostalgic gap the Cultural Revolution left when many ancient Chinese artifacts were lost, and a mass-production economy took over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the Chinese characters 'Shang' and 'Xia', the brand name literally means 'Up-Down'. This may sound confounding at first, but a deeper look at these characters gives us an insight into oriental philosophy: up and down are opposites, and so are workmanship and technology. The circulation between the two energies of Yin and Yang (past and future), the fusion of tradition and innovation, blend of age-old craftsmanship and cosmopolitan design, all illustrate the Shang Xia relationship. Shang Xia is not about choosing either of the alternatives; it's about keeping them both. The brand's concept exhibits a flow of energy from past to future and aims to evoke emotion and adulation while rekindling the relationship with history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shang Xia is popularly called by the moniker 'Chinese Hermes' in China for successfully harmonising the Hermes ideology of modernization with traditional Chinese handiwork. Rather than solely relying on the stature of Hermes, it has independently polished its own character by preserving Chinese ingenuity and has thus, become a source of the industry's collective marvel. For instance, the ready-to-wear line at Shang Xia is inspired by the Han dynasty, cherishing the dynasty's free-spirited silhouettes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The designs of the brand resonate the elegance of splendid simplicity yet pronounced differentiation. At Shang Xia, each item is intricately crafted with raw materials sourced from within China. Its product strategies are inconsistent with those pursued by other luxury brands in China and it markets itself to the upper echelons through its own interpretation of design and fashion. It does not believe in conspicuous consumption and hence, its products lack the glitz and glamour that most brands flash to lure the Chinese consumers. These products appeal to a mass audience because of their understated sophistication and timeless aesthetics. People recognize Shang Xia products from a distance because of the distinctive authenticity and rustic elements that they incorporate. The price continuum is such that it anticipates the desire of aristocracy through outstanding pieces and at the same time, satisfies the need of proletariats through accessible collections (again reflecting the Shang Xia relationship).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to global luxury brands which are always on the lookout to spread their branches in different countries, Shang Xia hasn't expanded much in its ten years of existence with most of its boutiques limited to the Chinese mainland and only one boutique in Paris. CEO Jiang explains this as a step towards ensuring the production of items of superior craftsmanship. Jiang does not have the ambition to build a brand empire since she believes that increasing the output would compromise quality. She yearns to build the brand in the long-term rather than maximise profits in the short run. Jiang feels that fortifying the brand by expanding into new product categories shall overexpose them and would ultimately lead to dilution of brand equity and loss in the aura and charisma of their products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a network of only fifty artisans from all over Asia, Shang Xia's products come in limited quantities leaving its customers waiting for months to get their hands on them. This allows them to retain their exclusivity, thereby reinforcing the idea of luxury. The company also lays a huge emphasis on developing a narrative behind each of its products and also dedicates a space on its website to display the salience of eggshell porcelain, bamboo weaving, cashmere felt sculpting, and Zitan (a rare wood found only in China and southern India) which are all used in creating their products. Even the in-store client advisors are well-versed with such stories, allowing the customers to understand and appreciate the brand philosophy. Furthermore, the brand also obliges the demand for customisation in products for an additional premium cost. All these individual elements reflect the brand's overarching product strategy, which is built around exquisite mastery of classic techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Shang Xia's initial brand communications, there was a mammoth impediment to selling the idea of Chinese luxury; at that time, the local Asian brands were perceived to be inferior both in terms of quality and value to foreign brands. To tackle this issue of the negative association of 'Made-in-China', they created a digital campaign surrounding a mysterious masked man who traveled from China to Paris to bring 'culture-seeds'. The enigmatic story and the campaign's extravagant aesthetics were enough to generate enormous hype and impressions on the brand's social media platforms. From designing its boutiques in Zen-style to invoke a sense of tranquillity to bringing craftsmen to live-showcase their skills and finesse, Shang Xia has maintained its stores as a vital brand element.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focussing on brand experience, it serves high-tea at its stores to let the customers savour and delight in Chinese rituals and customs. However, since the brand's launch, Shang Xia has relied on word-of-mouth instead of advertising. It uses exclusive fashion exhibitions and curated art events to promote the brand and disseminate the brand ideology and sensibilities. At the time of its launch, Shang Xia, contrary to introducing its products, sought to build a contextual foundation. It juxtaposed Chinese history and modern luxury to let the Chinese consumers revere the past and consider it as worthy of rediscovery. It displayed a collection of mundane personal souvenirs outside the stores that were previously not associated with having any luxury value to ignite a spirit of heritage and opulence. These concerted efforts in building the brand have made the Chinese consumers embrace the brand wholeheartedly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China's rapidly growing economy and the rising per capita income of Chinese citizens have increased the demand for luxury goods. The number of Chinese shoppers traveling overseas has also skyrocketed in recent years. These consumers have increasingly been exposed to luxury products via the internet, foreign travel, and experiential stores. Consequently, they have become more cognisant and savvier in ascertaining the value proposition of these goods. Interestingly, at variance with the Western world, luxury consumption in China is dominated by men who demonstrate an inclination towards inconspicuous goods rather than ostentatiously displaying colossal logos of the brands. They aspire towards a refined and cultured lifestyle that is in sync with cultured ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Shang Xia's goods not showing any decline of demand over time, the issues of long gestation periods and the overwhelming time required to upskill the artisans has become more glaring. It poses a gargantuan hurdle in ramping up its supply chain. The brand has always been conservative regarding leveraging digital and online experiences. With coronavirus taking over the world by storm, it needs to keep 'integrating physical and virtual stores and creating an omnichannel experience' an utmost priority. The bulky clout of Shang Xia in the Chinese luxury realm and its soaring popularity among the Chinese gentry is also attracting other global fashion conglomerates to hop on this lucrative bandwagon of transfusing their philosophy into China's home-grown brands.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Jiang dreams of skilling the younger generation in artistry by opening a new 'School of Craftsmanship' in the upcoming years. Since she does not envisage building a global retail empire, it is crucial for the brand's lionised backer Hermes to not succumb to revenue pressures. Intending to resurrect and nurture traditional expertise, it has carved a niche for itself. However, being niche is like an axe that cuts both ways, while it helps to charge a premium cost from the shoppers, it also limits the reach of the goods in public. Shang Xia, therefore, faces the constant challenge of reconciling strategic imperatives, that is, to enshrine the Chinese culture and at the same time build a sustainable business. Undoubtedly, there is enormous potential in Shang Xia's ornate vision, but the company can only thrive if it responds to competitive pressures efficiently and epitomizes the Chinese slang &quot;Ji Qing Yu Wu&quot;!

The brand's concept exhibits a flow of energy from past to future and aims to evoke emotion and adulation while rekindling the relationship with history.&amp;nbsp; Shang Xia is popularly called by the moniker 'Chinese Hermes' in China for successfully harmonising the Hermes ideology of modernization with traditional Chinese handiwork. Rather than solely relying on the stature of Hermes, it has independently polished its own character by preserving Chinese ingenuity and has thus, become a source of the industry's collective marvel. For instance, the ready-to-wear line at Shang Xia is inspired by the Han dynasty, cherishing the dynasty's free-spirited silhouettes.&amp;nbsp; The designs of the brand resonate the elegance of splendid simplicity yet pronounced differentiation. At Shang Xia, each item is intricately crafted with raw materials sourced from within China. Its product strategies are inconsistent with those pursued by other luxury brands in China and it markets itself to the upper echelons through its own interpretation of design and fashion. It does not believe in conspicuous consumption and hence, its products lack the glitz and glamour that most brands flash to lure the Chinese consumers. These products appeal to a mass audience because of their understated sophistication and timeless aesthetics. People recognize Shang Xia products from a distance because of the distinctive authenticity and rustic elements that they incorporate. The price continuum is such that it anticipates the desire of aristocracy through outstanding pieces and at the same time, satisfies the need of proletariats through accessible collections (again reflecting the Shang Xia relationship).&amp;nbsp; In contrast to global luxury brands which are always on the lookout to spread their branches in different countries, Shang Xia hasn't expanded much in its ten years of existence with most of its boutiques limited to the Chinese mainland and only one boutique in Paris. CEO Jiang explains this as a step towards ensuring the production of items of superior craftsmanship. Jiang does not have the ambition to build a brand empire since she believes that increasing the output would compromise quality. She yearns to build the brand in the long-term rather than maximise profits in the short run. Jiang feels that fortifying the brand by expanding into new product categories shall overexpose them and would ultimately lead to dilution of brand equity and loss in the aura and charisma of their products.&amp;nbsp; With a network of only fifty artisans from all over Asia, Shang Xia's products come in limited quantities leaving its customers waiting for months to get their hands on them. This allows them to retain their exclusivity, thereby reinforcing the idea of luxury. The company also lays a huge emphasis on developing a narrative behind each of its products and also dedicates a space on its website to display the salience of eggshell porcelain, bamboo weaving, cashmere felt sculpting, and Zitan (a rare wood found only in China and southern India) which are all used in creating their products. Even the in-store client advisors are well-versed with such stories, allowing the customers to understand and appreciate the brand philosophy. Furthermore, the brand also obliges the demand for customisation in products for an additional premium cost. All these individual elements reflect the brand's overarching product strategy, which is built around exquisite mastery of classic techniques.&amp;nbsp; During Shang Xia's initial brand communications, there was a mammoth impediment to selling the idea of Chinese luxury; at that time, the local Asian brands were perceived to be inferior both in terms of quality and value to foreign brands. To tackle this issue of the negative association of 'Made-in-China', they created a digital campaign surrounding a mysterious masked man who traveled from China to Paris to bring 'culture-seeds'. The enigmatic story and the campaign's extravagant aesthetics were enough to generate enormous hype and impressions on the brand's social media platforms. From designing its boutiques in Zen-style to invoke a sense of tranquillity to bringing craftsmen to live-showcase their skills and finesse, Shang Xia has maintained its stores as a vital brand element.&amp;nbsp; Focussing on brand experience, it serves high-tea at its stores to let the customers savour and delight in Chinese rituals and customs. However, since the brand's launch, Shang Xia has relied on word-of-mouth instead of advertising. It uses exclusive fashion exhibitions and curated art events to promote the brand and disseminate the brand ideology and sensibilities. At the time of its launch, Shang Xia, contrary to introducing its products, sought to build a contextual foundation. It juxtaposed Chinese history and modern luxury to let the Chinese consumers revere the past and consider it as worthy of rediscovery. It displayed a collection of mundane personal souvenirs outside the stores that were previously not associated with having any luxury value to ignite a spirit of heritage and opulence. These concerted efforts in building the brand have made the Chinese consumers embrace the brand wholeheartedly.&amp;nbsp; China's rapidly growing economy and the rising per capita income of Chinese citizens have increased the demand for luxury goods. The number of Chinese shoppers traveling overseas has also skyrocketed in recent years. These consumers have increasingly been exposed to luxury products via the internet, foreign travel, and experiential stores. Consequently, they have become more cognisant and savvier in ascertaining the value proposition of these goods. Interestingly, at variance with the Western world, luxury consumption in China is dominated by men who demonstrate an inclination towards inconspicuous goods rather than ostentatiously displaying colossal logos of the brands. They aspire towards a refined and cultured lifestyle that is in sync with cultured ideas. With Shang Xia's goods not showing any decline of demand over time, the issues of long gestation periods and the overwhelming time required to upskill the artisans has become more glaring. It poses a gargantuan hurdle in ramping up its supply chain. The brand has always been conservative regarding leveraging digital and online experiences. With coronavirus taking over the world by storm, it needs to keep 'integrating physical and virtual stores and creating an omnichannel experience' an utmost priority. The bulky clout of Shang Xia in the Chinese luxury realm and its soaring popularity among the Chinese gentry is also attracting other global fashion conglomerates to hop on this lucrative bandwagon of transfusing their philosophy into China's home-grown brands.&amp;nbsp; CEO Jiang dreams of skilling the younger generation in artistry by opening a new 'School of Craftsmanship' in the upcoming years. Since she does not envisage building a global retail empire, it is crucial for the brand's lionised backer Hermes to not succumb to revenue pressures. Intending to resurrect and nurture traditional expertise, it has carved a niche for itself. However, being niche is like an axe that cuts both ways, while it helps to charge a premium cost from the shoppers, it also limits the reach of the goods in public. Shang Xia, therefore, faces the constant challenge of reconciling strategic imperatives, that is, to enshrine the Chinese culture and at the same time build a sustainable business. Undoubtedly, there is enormous potential in Shang Xia's ornate vision, but the company can only thrive if it responds to competitive pressures efficiently and epitomizes the Chinese slang &quot;Ji Qing Yu Wu&quot;!

The evidence of human-induced climate change in every region across the globe is irrefutable and some of these changes are already ‘irreversible’ for centuries to millennia, according to the IPCC report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ipcc.ch/about/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&lt;/a&gt; (IPCC) was set up by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organisation in 1988. Its main purpose is to provide governments at all levels with scientific information which they can use to develop climate-related policies. The sixth assessment report, compiled by more than 200 scientists over a period of several years and approved by 195 governments is the first in a trio gauging the state of climate change, efforts to alleviate it and to adapt to it. The document, which was described as &lt;em&gt;&quot;a code red for humanity&quot;&lt;/em&gt; by UN Secretary-General António Guterres, arrived less than three months before the major global climate summit in Glasgow, UK, which took place from October 31 to November 12, 2021, and where governments had the opportunity to make pledges to reverse course and reduce emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The report identifies that “&lt;em&gt;anthropogenic activities have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels and if no action isn’t taken, global warming is likely to reach 1.5°C by 2030”&lt;/em&gt;. This warming is set to persist for generations, even if zero emission pathways are enforced incontinently. The effects of 1°C global warming are already visible in sea level rise, surge in intensity of heat waves, glacier retreat, coral deaths, more frequent and more severe storms, floods and droughts. According to the report, there will be “&lt;em&gt;no region that will be left unscathed by the impacts of climate change”&lt;/em&gt;, with huge human and economic costs that far outweigh the costs of action. Regions like the Mediterranean, Southern Africa, the western United States, the Amazon and Australia will experience increased droughts and fires, which will affect not only the ecosystems but livelihoods, agriculture, and water systems. Infrastructure, transport, energy production and tourism in North America, the Arctic, Europe, the Andes, and more might be hugely impacted by the changes in snow, ice and river flooding. Storms will probably become more severe over most of North America, Europe, and the Mediterranean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The report points out that the Earth's precious carbon sinks, land and oceans, are at immense risk. They presently perform an astounding service in absorbing the bulk of the carbon dioxide the world emits, but as emissions rise, they will become less effective at absorbing CO2. These land sinks will eventually turn into a source, emitting CO2 instead of sucking it in; for example, the southeast Amazon rainforest is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01871-6&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no longer a carbon sink&lt;/a&gt; mainly because of deforestation and local warming. This can lead to uncontrolled warming, which will not only affect the world’s climate efforts, but can pose significant food and water security risks to countries in the region, and may lead to irreversible biodiversity loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;According to Govindasamy Bala, professor of Climate Change, for the first time, the new report clarifies the ‘&lt;em&gt;delicate balance’&lt;/em&gt; between aerosols and GHG emissions and their influence on precipitation by noting that “&lt;em&gt;greenhouse gas warming is partially offset by aerosol cooling&lt;/em&gt;.” Greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to intensification of rainfall, but from the 1950’s to 1980’s, there was a drop in global land monsoon precipitation and it was somewhat attributed to human-caused Northern Hemisphere aerosol ejection, which signifies that the aerosol cooling effect overpowered the greenhouse effect during the 30 year period. We don't see any trend in &lt;a href=&quot;https://india.mongabay.com/2020/11/how-wildlife-outside-protected-areas-responds-to-climate-extremes/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;monsoon&lt;/a&gt; rainfall in the last three decades, mainly because the effects of GHGs and aerosols are almost balanced. In the coming couple of decades this delicate balance may continue but by mid or end of the century the report predicts that we will see a surge in precipitation, Bala explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;According to the IPCC, there is a &lt;em&gt;direct link between the surge in global warming and extreme climate changes&lt;/em&gt;. At 2°C of global warming, heat shocks are more likely to reach critical forbearance thresholds for biodiversity, i.e. out of the 105,000 species that were studied, it is predicted that 8% of plants, 9.6% of insects and 4% of vertebrates will lose over half of their geographic range at 1.5°C, compared with 16% of plants, 18% of insects and 8% of vertebrates at 2°C.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Repercussions associated with other biodiversity-related risks, for instance, the spread of non-native species and forest fires, are lower at 1.5°C compared to 2°C of global warming.&amp;nbsp; Extreme sea level events that used to occur once a century previously could happen every year by 2100.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Thus, the report ascertains that there will be major benefits to limiting global warming to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level, but doing so will need “&lt;em&gt;rapid, far reaching and extraordinary changes in all aspects of society&lt;/em&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathways to safety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;As reported by the IPCC, around 85% of CO₂ emissions come from burning fossil fuels. It is much easier to stop releasing more CO₂ into the atmosphere than it is to eliminate it, and the more we emit, the further we degrade the ecosystems that naturally soak it up. Therefore, global net CO₂ emissions by humans have to shrink by about 45% by 2030 relative to 2010 levels and reach net zero by 2050. This is actually achievable, contrary to popular belief through mitigation measures in the energy sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;About 70–85% of electricity is expected to be supplied by renewable sources in 2050. Shares of nuclear and fossil energy with Carbon Capture and Sequestration/Storage (CCS) are modelled to increase, allowing the share of carbon emitted in the atmosphere to fall and natural gas to generate about 8% of global electricity in 2050. All these mitigation measures will need an annual average investment in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion (at 2010 prices) between 2016 and 2035, representing about 2.5% of the world GDP;&amp;nbsp;however, the cost of inaction and delay will be many times more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Following these pathways, the use of coal will be almost negligible by 2050, which might worry Indian policymakers, who are still talking about getting 45% of the country’s electricity from coal around the middle of the century. It's expected that by 2050, about 75–90% of CO₂ emissions from industry will be lower relative to current levels. The IPCC says this can be accomplished through &quot;&lt;em&gt;combinations of new and already existing technologies and practises, including product substitution, electrification, sustainable bio-based feedstock, carbon capture, utilisation, and storage.&lt;/em&gt;&quot; All this will not only help us tackle the climate change situation but also help us achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are expected to rise. Because economies have been hard hit, every country is desperate for recovery, which can primarily be accomplished with the current brown economy, which includes using coal, gas, and oil to ratchet up growth as quickly as possible. But the good news is that we have technologies that can disrupt the current fossil-fuel-driven industrial system. We cannot wait for disruptive technologies; rather, we must be disruptive in action or it will be too late.

But that’s not quite right. You can complain about the NHS all you like, as long as you add “…But it’s not the system! It’s because it’s mismanaged and drained of money!” I’m here to tell you that, I’m sorry, it is actually the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our doctors and nurses are heroes. That’s not a good thing. Or to be precise, it’s not good that they are &lt;em&gt;required to be&lt;/em&gt; heroes. If a doctor exhausts herself without time to take a break, we should applaud her as a hero, then fix the system so she never has to do it again. Instead, we ask her to do it every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t live in the UK and you want to know what the NHS is like, take a peek at &lt;em&gt;Dear NHS: 100 Stories to say Thank You&lt;/em&gt;. This is supposed to be a feel-good book that makes you love the NHS. Yet half the chapters are horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They go like this: “I had a health issue. I went to the hospital, waited several hours in pain, and was told I was in the wrong place. Eventually I was seen by a doctor who was 12 hours into his shift without eating, and even though he could have gone home, he went beyond the call of duty to help me. Thank you thank you thank you NHS!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who may want another example, here is another:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;There were no seats. I helped Cath to a wall. […] Another man was bleeding, quite heavily, from a head wound. […] Eventually, after what, in fact, turned out to be only three-and-a-half hours, a woman appeared and told us she was the triage.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;~ Frank Skinner, &lt;em&gt;Dear NHS: 100 Stories to Say Thank You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what’s going wrong? This is where I’m supposed to say, it’s underfunded! Except that’s not true any more, the NHS gets just as much cash as the Dutch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you can say, it’s because of those politicians messing it up! This makes even less sense. The whole design of the NHS is a national system, funded by taxes and run by the government. You can’t support a nationalised system, and then get upset when you don’t like the people in power. It’s centralised by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dream of the NHS is for everyone to have accessible, affordable healthcare. This is a great thing. Really. Unfortunately, setting up a massive tax-funded monopoly is a bad way to do it. This was a product of the flawed economic thinking of the 40's, which idolised the state planning of the Soviet Union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old joke from the Soviet Union goes like this: A man buys a car. The clerk tells him it will arrive in exactly one year. “Morning or afternoon?” asks the man. “It’s a whole year away, why does it matter?” replies the clerk. “Well,” says the man, “the plumber’s coming in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NHS works on the same timescale. Its 18 week target, already outrageous, is routinely missed. Before we ever heard of COVID-19, over 200,000 people waited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/13/nhs-operation-waiting-lists-reach-10-year-high-at-43m-patients&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;half a year for routine surgery&lt;/a&gt;. In Northern Ireland, healthcare barely exists. Need pain management? Wait three years. General surgery? Five years. Urology? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-57435683&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;7 years&lt;/a&gt;. Go home with your dodgy bladder and don’t come back till 2029.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to exaggerate. The NHS (in the rest of the UK) is no longer the disaster it was 20 years ago. These days it’s about on par with Slovenia. But, no offence to Slovenia, we should be aiming higher! If we want to survive cancer at the same rates as the Belgians or Dutch, we need to look at the Belgian and Dutch systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it turns out, this is a solved problem, and the answer is &lt;em&gt;social health insurance&lt;/em&gt;. NOT the American system – which is messed up in a whole different way – but the gentle systems of Germany, Israel, Switzerland and others. In short, you choose your insurance company, which pays for your care. There is a money transfer system between the insurers, so they are happy to take anybody as a customer, even the elderly and long-term sick. And for the poorest people, the state pays their insurance bills. Everybody has healthcare, nobody goes bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this save more lives than the NHS? Because you get freedom of choice. If you don’t like one clinic, you choose another. If you don’t like one insurer, you choose another. Your money follows you around, so just like any decent market (think of groceries, pharmacies, opticians, really almost anything), the companies try their best to please you. This is why healthcare is so much better in Western Europe. It’s also bog-standard mainstream economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying the private sector is perfect. Anyone who has worked in a big company knows they have problems too. The point is, there is a limit to how wasteful they can get, because if they don’t make you happy, they fail. There is really no limit to how wasteful a bureaucracy like the NHS can be. After all, even if you can’t see a GP without desperately phoning at exactly 8am and begging the receptionist, you still have to pay thousands of pounds of tax a year for the privilege. You can’t say no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And by the way, it costs us a lot more than it looks like, because of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadweight-loss-of-taxation.asp&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;deadweight loss of taxation&lt;/a&gt;… but that’s a topic for another day.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, can’t we just reform the NHS to equal the Germans, without letting competition in? Alas, it’s impossible. I mean, it’s literally impossible. A state monopoly can’t try different setups to see what works. There is no pool of entrepreneurs looking for the slightest opportunity to improve things. Instead you get an increasingly elaborate web of targets that has nothing to do with patient care. That’s why the Soviet Union was full of shortages. The NHS is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s also why NHS technology is famously outdated. How long will it keep bursting people’s eardrums with syringes, when it should be using microsuction? Or forcing midwives at my local maternity ward to use block capitals on a blue screen? I wish I was joking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The NHS is our single greatest achievement as a country, and the NHS is you. The 1.5 million people who go above and beyond the call of duty every single day.&quot; &lt;/em&gt;~ Adam Kay, &lt;em&gt;Dear NHS: 100 Stories to Say Thank You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote sums up the problem. In reality, NHS outcomes are mediocre (in other words, lots of people die when they don't have to). Confusing the NHS with its long-suffering staff is why we can’t have a sensible debate, 1.5 million people are far too many to organise effectively. And most importantly, our care staff obviously should not have to go above and beyond the call of duty every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, we can transition to a European-style social health insurance system quite easily! We already have Clinical Commissioning Groups, which are pretty similar to health insurers. Your local CCG has a lot of power over your life (and death), and you don’t even know its name. The first step is to give people free choice of CCG, then allow charities and companies to become CCGs too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds good to you (and it should!), I highly recommend the free book &lt;em&gt;Universal healthcare without the NHS&lt;/em&gt; by Kristian Niemitz. We can have modern healthcare for everyone without the crazy waiting lists. We just have to look across the Channel, and we’ll all be a lot happier and healthier.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>.</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="policy" /><category term="humanity" /><summary type="html">I used to think it was taboo to criticise the National Health Service (NHS). But that’s not quite right. You can complain about the NHS all you like, as long as you add “…But it’s not the system! It’s because it’s mismanaged and drained of money!” I’m here to tell you that, I’m sorry, it is actually the system. Our doctors and nurses are heroes. That’s not a good thing. Or to be precise, it’s not good that they are required to be heroes. If a doctor exhausts herself without time to take a break, we should applaud her as a hero, then fix the system so she never has to do it again. Instead, we ask her to do it every day. If you don’t live in the UK and you want to know what the NHS is like, take a peek at Dear NHS: 100 Stories to say Thank You. This is supposed to be a feel-good book that makes you love the NHS. Yet half the chapters are horror stories. They go like this: “I had a health issue. I went to the hospital, waited several hours in pain, and was told I was in the wrong place. Eventually I was seen by a doctor who was 12 hours into his shift without eating, and even though he could have gone home, he went beyond the call of duty to help me. Thank you thank you thank you NHS!” For those who may want another example, here is another:&amp;nbsp; &quot;There were no seats. I helped Cath to a wall. […] Another man was bleeding, quite heavily, from a head wound. […] Eventually, after what, in fact, turned out to be only three-and-a-half hours, a woman appeared and told us she was the triage.&quot; ~ Frank Skinner, Dear NHS: 100 Stories to Say Thank You So what’s going wrong? This is where I’m supposed to say, it’s underfunded! Except that’s not true any more, the NHS gets just as much cash as the Dutch. Or you can say, it’s because of those politicians messing it up! This makes even less sense. The whole design of the NHS is a national system, funded by taxes and run by the government. You can’t support a nationalised system, and then get upset when you don’t like the people in power. It’s centralised by design. The dream of the NHS is for everyone to have accessible, affordable healthcare. This is a great thing. Really. Unfortunately, setting up a massive tax-funded monopoly is a bad way to do it. This was a product of the flawed economic thinking of the 40's, which idolised the state planning of the Soviet Union. An old joke from the Soviet Union goes like this: A man buys a car. The clerk tells him it will arrive in exactly one year. “Morning or afternoon?” asks the man. “It’s a whole year away, why does it matter?” replies the clerk. “Well,” says the man, “the plumber’s coming in the morning.” The NHS works on the same timescale. Its 18 week target, already outrageous, is routinely missed. Before we ever heard of COVID-19, over 200,000 people waited half a year for routine surgery. In Northern Ireland, healthcare barely exists. Need pain management? Wait three years. General surgery? Five years. Urology? 7 years. Go home with your dodgy bladder and don’t come back till 2029.&amp;nbsp; I don’t want to exaggerate. The NHS (in the rest of the UK) is no longer the disaster it was 20 years ago. These days it’s about on par with Slovenia. But, no offence to Slovenia, we should be aiming higher! If we want to survive cancer at the same rates as the Belgians or Dutch, we need to look at the Belgian and Dutch systems.&amp;nbsp; Because it turns out, this is a solved problem, and the answer is social health insurance. NOT the American system – which is messed up in a whole different way – but the gentle systems of Germany, Israel, Switzerland and others. In short, you choose your insurance company, which pays for your care. There is a money transfer system between the insurers, so they are happy to take anybody as a customer, even the elderly and long-term sick. And for the poorest people, the state pays their insurance bills. Everybody has healthcare, nobody goes bankrupt. Why does this save more lives than the NHS? Because you get freedom of choice. If you don’t like one clinic, you choose another. If you don’t like one insurer, you choose another. Your money follows you around, so just like any decent market (think of groceries, pharmacies, opticians, really almost anything), the companies try their best to please you. This is why healthcare is so much better in Western Europe. It’s also bog-standard mainstream economics. I am not saying the private sector is perfect. Anyone who has worked in a big company knows they have problems too. The point is, there is a limit to how wasteful they can get, because if they don’t make you happy, they fail. There is really no limit to how wasteful a bureaucracy like the NHS can be. After all, even if you can’t see a GP without desperately phoning at exactly 8am and begging the receptionist, you still have to pay thousands of pounds of tax a year for the privilege. You can’t say no. (And by the way, it costs us a lot more than it looks like, because of the deadweight loss of taxation… but that’s a topic for another day.) So, can’t we just reform the NHS to equal the Germans, without letting competition in? Alas, it’s impossible. I mean, it’s literally impossible. A state monopoly can’t try different setups to see what works. There is no pool of entrepreneurs looking for the slightest opportunity to improve things. Instead you get an increasingly elaborate web of targets that has nothing to do with patient care. That’s why the Soviet Union was full of shortages. The NHS is the same. That’s also why NHS technology is famously outdated. How long will it keep bursting people’s eardrums with syringes, when it should be using microsuction? Or forcing midwives at my local maternity ward to use block capitals on a blue screen? I wish I was joking. &quot;The NHS is our single greatest achievement as a country, and the NHS is you. The 1.5 million people who go above and beyond the call of duty every single day.&quot; ~ Adam Kay, Dear NHS: 100 Stories to Say Thank You This quote sums up the problem.

Digging deeper into it would display numbers showing how each country compares with its international counterpart or neighbouring countries. Governments boast of their economic growth figures on international platforms but do these figures translate into actual economic development? Seldom do these numbers take into account how growth affects each individual in an economy. In neglecting the intersectionality a country possesses, governments often fail to account for the needs of the more vulnerable,&amp;nbsp; and equitable access to resources takes a backseat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;A classic example of this practice is the lack of discussion, and the subsequent lack of policy measures, on the provision of sanitation facilities across various developing countries. The neglect of sanitation tends to disproportionately affect women and girls globally since social constraints dictate women to carry out their sanitation activities at far off locations during odd hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;In most cultures and across low income countries in Asia and Africa, women and girls are primarily responsible for the management of household water supply, sanitation and health. It is a time-consuming and taxing activity that involves travelling great distances and leaving work or school if water is made available during working hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Yet, when policy discussions on sanitation take place, female users’ involvement in the design and location of sanitation facilities is kept severely limited. It is alarming how despite playing prominent roles and responsibilities in household water and sanitation, women are often out of the purview of consideration when such facilities are in the pipeline. Such discrimination leads to an excess burden on women and girls, and their productive participation in the economy suffers as a result since most of their time is spent performing unpaid domestic work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Moreover, women are often subjected to abuse and gender-based violence when they are forced to walk to shared sanitation facilities or open defecation sites. The fear of sexual assault and harassment among women and girls while conducting sanitation activities has been documented extensively in places like Ethiopia, India and several refugee or internally-displaced persons' camps. There are several issues with women's access to open defecation. To reduce their vulnerability to sexual assault, they are forced to visit open defecation sites before dawn or at night, and in groups. This is proof of the looming fear of sexual violence that can limit freedom of movement and affect equal opportunities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Defecation in public causes its own set of issues, such as polluted water and an increase in the prevalence of water-borne illnesses, ultimately affecting the entire society at large. Women in India that can access public sanitation facilities find them typically filthy. In addition, men congregate near these facilities to verbally and sexually assault women as they attempt to use the facilities. Consequently, women tend to walk in groups to such facilities and often face time constraints and scheduling issues. The resulting health issues from poor sanitation, the absence of access to facilities at a convenient time and place, and the risk of violence has been severely under-investigated in sanitation-related research globally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The World Health Organisation (WHO) came up with a measure called ‘sanitation insecurity score’, which measures the relationship between access to functioning sanitation facilities and psychological distress prevalent among women and found the former is predictive of the latter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;In rural India, women and girls have a high sanitation insecurity score, which naturally leads to poor mental health. Further research on the physical and mental consequences of poor sanitation facilities on women, and how that deepens the gender divide and distorts the economic well-being of women and girls is an urgent necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Another area of concern is the effect of poor sanitation on women’s physical and mental health during the time of menstruation, pregnancy, child-rearing, and other illnesses. Their specific hygiene needs are severely unmet during such times, which makes girls and women more vulnerable to health-related risks. These unmet needs often result in the restriction of equal participation of women in society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Various studies have indicated a strong association between poor sanitation and adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth rate. However, a lot more needs to be studied on the overall health implications of inadequate sanitation on women and girls. The lack of sanitation facilities in schools and workplaces also has a significant impact on female literacy and labour force participation rates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;While there is much evidence of the impact of lack of toilets in schools on girls’ participation in education, there is far less evidence gathered on the absence of proper sanitation on working women, especially in the informal sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;A priority area of focus in today’s age should be the participation of women in sanitation and hygiene decision-making. The effective use of water and sanitation facilities will be dependent on both men and women participating in the location and technology of such facilities, as well as taking responsibility for their operation and maintenance. There is evidence that empowering women to make sanitation decisions can improve household and community performance outcomes since their influence on sanitation and hygiene behaviour in households is undeniable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;There is a lot that is yet to be achieved in terms of gender equity in several developing countries and regions of the world. The imminent need to adopt equitable practices into policy at all levels will be crucial to achieving the desired sanitation goals of any country. Furthermore, inequitable practices have cost millions of girls and women a chance at education and work and have severely limited the economic productivity of several developing countries by restricting the participation of women. With better access to safe sanitation facilities, the world will certainly witness improvements in health, educational outcomes, and productivity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Essentially, sanitation accounts for a major chunk of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of any country, which also includes education and work. The sanitation discussion draws our attention to the need to reject the notion that economic growth figures demonstrate a country's overall performance. The need to assess economic development while accounting for equitable distribution and access to resources is pressing.

But have you ever wondered how these organisations feed off hunger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article attempts to capture the Hunger Industrial Complex (a mechanism by which huge, capitalist organisations systemically perpetuate hunger in order to reap profits, all while maintaining the facade of ‘anti-hunger proponents’) through the story of the US.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chronology is simple. People are hungry. They can’t afford food. (Primarily because while the federal minimum wage in the US has been stuck at $7.25, the cost of groceries has &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/what-is-the-anti-hunger-industrial-complex/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gone up by 25% &lt;/a&gt;in the past decade.) Anti-hunger groups bank on charities from huge corporations to feed the hungry. These corporations shell out millions for the ‘noble cause’, while ensuring they turn a deaf ear to their employees demanding a wage hike, which would eliminate the need for food banks in the first place. People are hungry, again, the next day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the complexities better, we need to visit the three main actors in the process: The Donors, The Anti-Hunger Groups and Food Banks, and The Government, and trace their complicity and contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's first visit the big corporations vis-a-vis the benefactors or &lt;em&gt;donors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to food banks through the lens of Walmart. As the largest employer in the US with nearly 1.6 million workers, Walmart has faced criticism for years over low wages, wage theft, and keeping workers on part-time schedules to shirk off employee security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;You can’t pay your bills, rent and buy groceries on $12 an hour. I don’t think anywhere in the United States, you can do that. No way&lt;/em&gt;,” said Mendy Hughes, 46, who has worked as a cashier for Walmart in Arkansas, for 11 years. Anna Turner, who had worked at Walmart in California for more than eight years before being fired for complaining about COVID-19 mismanagement in the workplace, noted that she made less than $15 an hour and was never hired for full-time hours, even though the department was chronically understaffed. “&lt;em&gt;They would always cut our hours so we couldn’t get full-time and health benefits&lt;/em&gt;,” said Turner. (Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/28/walmart-pay-hourly-low-wages-working-conditions&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, even the Food Stamp Program that the US government has in place to provide food-purchasing assistance to low- and no-income people connects back to Walmart making money! Americans spend about &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303843104579168011245171266?mod=djemITP_h&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;18% of all food stamp dollars&lt;/a&gt; at Walmart, which gives Walmart all the more incentive to force its employees to rely on food stamps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically, Walmart is encouraging its employees to get food stamps, or go to food banks, because they don’t pay them enough wages in the first place. And surprisingly, the atrocities are legal as the federal minimum wage in the US, as mentioned before, is $7.25!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Walmart’s not the only culprit, there are so many more corporations playing this game. In 2012, Arby’s (one of the biggest fast-foo&lt;a href=&quot;https://civileats.com/2013/09/05/the-anti-hunger-industrial-complex/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;d chains of America)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://civileats.com/2013/09/05/the-anti-hunger-industrial-complex/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;raised $2.7 million&lt;/a&gt; for the hunger cause, most of which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arbysfoundation.org/Fundraiser.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went to Share Our Strength&lt;/a&gt;, an organisation aiming to end childhood hunger. Ironically, all this while, Arby’s employees were protesting the fact that they didn’t earn enough to feed their children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now another question arises, why would these companies rather make huge donations than pay their employees a little more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two facets to the answer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the ‘Maths’ of it. It wouldn’t require much calculation to figure that paying a ‘little’ more to millions of employees, every month, compounds to a much greater price than shelling out a good chunk of bucks every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the ‘PR’ of it. Donations and charities facilitate corporations to ‘greenwash’ their damaged reputations and boost their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) contribution in ways pay hikes could never accomplish. Charities make these corporations look like ‘hunger fighters’ instead of ‘hunger causers’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could still, for a minute, understand corporate complicity. But what about the food banks? What about anti-hunger groups?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s visit these one by one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&lt;em&gt; food bank &lt;/em&gt;is a non-profit, charitable organisation that distributes food to those without the resources to evade their hunger, through intermediaries like food pantries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few decades, food banks have become an integral and accepted part of America’s hunger response. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_bank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981&lt;/a&gt;. In the early 1980's, President Reagan’s administration cut back several welfare programmes, which, combined with unemployment and a budding recession, led to a rapid rise in hunger relief activities. The “emergency food system”, supposedly a temporary measure, slowly became a rather permanent industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some believe food banks to be an example of active, caring citizenship, others express concern that the rise of food banks may corrode political support and incentive for welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next on the list are &lt;em&gt;anti-hunger groups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are organisations attempting to alleviate hunger through long-term solutions, anti-hunger programmes, etc. Anti-hunger groups usually tie up with food banks to further their cause.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many groups see their role as ensuring that no kid misses a meal, rather than reducing the growing economic inequality (the underlying cause of hunger in the US). Their approach is not hunger elimination, but hunger maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to a pertinent question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-hunger groups are feeding people. But why aren’t they fighting hunger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would expect anti-hunger groups to be lobbying for the signage of the living wage bill, or rallying against the violation of employees' rights at the hands of corporations like Walmart and Amazon. But it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps their lack of attention is grounded in the fact that many anti-hunger organisations find their roots in these greedy corporations. Look at these numbers: &lt;a href=&quot;https://civileats.com/2013/09/05/the-anti-hunger-industrial-complex/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One in every four&lt;/a&gt; food bank board members works at a Fortune 1000 company.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Walmart staff sit on the boards of about &lt;a href=&quot;https://civileats.com/2013/09/05/the-anti-hunger-industrial-complex/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;one of every eight &lt;/a&gt;food banks.&amp;nbsp; And they are actively stopping anti-hunger organisations from engaging in public policy activism that threatens their business interest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, anti-hunger groups and food banks are not the bad guys, they just seem to be trapped in an intricate system of exploitative capitalism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last actor is the &lt;em&gt;Government.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each year, the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) spends roughly half a billion dollars in buying produce from farmers, and donates them to food banks. However, if only they spent these resources in increasing social safety net programmes instead, the impact would be truly durable. But that’s an impossible feat to achieve given the lobbying power of the corporate giants in the halls of American Congress.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To synthesise, there’s nothing the food banks can do, and there’s nothing the government or corporations want to do. So what’s the bottom line?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-hunger movement needs to focus on anti-hunger efforts, not on charity but on the root causes of food insecurity, improving public health, and reducing income inequality. It needs anti-hunger groups to serve a broader agenda than just temporarily fading out hunger for the day, through federal programmes and charitable organisations. It needs to exact a much higher price from corporations in the form of greater social responsibility. It needs to urge the government to bring systemic changes, especially in the form of increased wages and benefits, policy reforms, etc. But most importantly, we need to familiarise ourselves with these systemic disadvantages and blockages, identify them, and uproot them, because, at the end of the day, no one deserves to be hungry.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eeshita Verma</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="business-finance" /><category term="humanity" /><summary type="html">You might have heard about corporations profiting from sexism, homophobia, physical insecurities, poverty, and even, you! But have you ever wondered how these organisations feed off hunger? This article attempts to capture the Hunger Industrial Complex (a mechanism by which huge, capitalist organisations systemically perpetuate hunger in order to reap profits, all while maintaining the facade of ‘anti-hunger proponents’) through the story of the US.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The chronology is simple. People are hungry. They can’t afford food. (Primarily because while the federal minimum wage in the US has been stuck at $7.25, the cost of groceries has gone up by 25% in the past decade.) Anti-hunger groups bank on charities from huge corporations to feed the hungry. These corporations shell out millions for the ‘noble cause’, while ensuring they turn a deaf ear to their employees demanding a wage hike, which would eliminate the need for food banks in the first place. People are hungry, again, the next day! To understand the complexities better, we need to visit the three main actors in the process: The Donors, The Anti-Hunger Groups and Food Banks, and The Government, and trace their complicity and contributions. Let's first visit the big corporations vis-a-vis the benefactors or donors to food banks through the lens of Walmart. As the largest employer in the US with nearly 1.6 million workers, Walmart has faced criticism for years over low wages, wage theft, and keeping workers on part-time schedules to shirk off employee security. “You can’t pay your bills, rent and buy groceries on $12 an hour. I don’t think anywhere in the United States, you can do that. No way,” said Mendy Hughes, 46, who has worked as a cashier for Walmart in Arkansas, for 11 years. Anna Turner, who had worked at Walmart in California for more than eight years before being fired for complaining about COVID-19 mismanagement in the workplace, noted that she made less than $15 an hour and was never hired for full-time hours, even though the department was chronically understaffed. “They would always cut our hours so we couldn’t get full-time and health benefits,” said Turner. (Source: The Guardian)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Moreover, even the Food Stamp Program that the US government has in place to provide food-purchasing assistance to low- and no-income people connects back to Walmart making money! Americans spend about 18% of all food stamp dollars at Walmart, which gives Walmart all the more incentive to force its employees to rely on food stamps.&amp;nbsp; So basically, Walmart is encouraging its employees to get food stamps, or go to food banks, because they don’t pay them enough wages in the first place. And surprisingly, the atrocities are legal as the federal minimum wage in the US, as mentioned before, is $7.25! Unsurprisingly, Walmart’s not the only culprit, there are so many more corporations playing this game. In 2012, Arby’s (one of the biggest fast-food chains of America) raised $2.7 million for the hunger cause, most of which went to Share Our Strength, an organisation aiming to end childhood hunger. Ironically, all this while, Arby’s employees were protesting the fact that they didn’t earn enough to feed their children.&amp;nbsp; Now another question arises, why would these companies rather make huge donations than pay their employees a little more? There are two facets to the answer.&amp;nbsp; First, the ‘Maths’ of it. It wouldn’t require much calculation to figure that paying a ‘little’ more to millions of employees, every month, compounds to a much greater price than shelling out a good chunk of bucks every now and then. Second, the ‘PR’ of it. Donations and charities facilitate corporations to ‘greenwash’ their damaged reputations and boost their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) contribution in ways pay hikes could never accomplish. Charities make these corporations look like ‘hunger fighters’ instead of ‘hunger causers’. I could still, for a minute, understand corporate complicity. But what about the food banks? What about anti-hunger groups? Let’s visit these one by one.&amp;nbsp; A food bank is a non-profit, charitable organisation that distributes food to those without the resources to evade their hunger, through intermediaries like food pantries.&amp;nbsp; In the past few decades, food banks have become an integral and accepted part of America’s hunger response. According to a comprehensive government survey completed in 2002, over 90% of food banks were established in the US after 1981. In the early 1980's, President Reagan’s administration cut back several welfare programmes, which, combined with unemployment and a budding recession, led to a rapid rise in hunger relief activities. The “emergency food system”, supposedly a temporary measure, slowly became a rather permanent industry. While some believe food banks to be an example of active, caring citizenship, others express concern that the rise of food banks may corrode political support and incentive for welfare. Next on the list are anti-hunger groups. These are organisations attempting to alleviate hunger through long-term solutions, anti-hunger programmes, etc. Anti-hunger groups usually tie up with food banks to further their cause.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Many groups see their role as ensuring that no kid misses a meal, rather than reducing the growing economic inequality (the underlying cause of hunger in the US). Their approach is not hunger elimination, but hunger maintenance. This brings us to a pertinent question. Anti-hunger groups are feeding people. But why aren’t they fighting hunger? One would expect anti-hunger groups to be lobbying for the signage of the living wage bill, or rallying against the violation of employees' rights at the hands of corporations like Walmart and Amazon. But it’s not that simple. Perhaps their lack of attention is grounded in the fact that many anti-hunger organisations find their roots in these greedy corporations. Look at these numbers: One in every four food bank board members works at a Fortune 1000 company. Walmart staff sit on the boards of about one of every eight food banks.&amp;nbsp; And they are actively stopping anti-hunger organisations from engaging in public policy activism that threatens their business interest.&amp;nbsp; So, anti-hunger groups and food banks are not the bad guys, they just seem to be trapped in an intricate system of exploitative capitalism.&amp;nbsp; The last actor is the Government. Each year, the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) spends roughly half a billion dollars in buying produce from farmers, and donates them to food banks. However, if only they spent these resources in increasing social safety net programmes instead, the impact would be truly durable. But that’s an impossible feat to achieve given the lobbying power of the corporate giants in the halls of American Congress.&amp;nbsp; To synthesise, there’s nothing the food banks can do, and there’s nothing the government or corporations want to do. So what’s the bottom line? Bottom Line The anti-hunger movement needs to focus on anti-hunger efforts, not on charity but on the root causes of food insecurity, improving public health, and reducing income inequality. It needs anti-hunger groups to serve a broader agenda than just temporarily fading out hunger for the day, through federal programmes and charitable organisations.
