The scandal was proof of privilege gone wild wherein some students got in through pure merit, while others due to preferences that are skewed in favour of the rich and white. The mastermind behind the whole conspiracy was William Rick Singer, an admissions consultant and ex-athletic coach helping the most flush family kids to get into elite colleges. It was estimated that over $25 million was paid to Singer for his services, which fell under the category of ‘charity.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;There were two distinct parts to the charges that explained the entire operation. First, the parents reportedly paid Singer to bribe coaches at schools to help recruit their kids into sports programs without having proven athletic ability. Second, the test preparation moderators were bribed by Singer to favourably evaluate students’ answers and extend the time limit on entrance tests. The investigation, code-named &lt;em&gt;Operation Varsity Blues&lt;/em&gt;, disclosed that this unethical college admission process was followed for as many as 750 families!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Since the uncovering, several measures have been taken. Singer and parents involved have pleaded guilty, indicted coaches have been fired or suspended, and some of the schools have rescinded the admission offers to students who were unethically inducted. While lawsuits have been filed and committees have been set up to review the allegations, the larger question remains: Why did this happen? Is it the over-fixation with the elite colleges in society, skewed ownership of social assets, or the guarantee of a successful life ahead attached to these premier institutions? The answer is a mixture of all three factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not The First Scandal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;While the 2019 scandal may seem like a new breaking phenomenon, it was not the first. Scandals like this have occurred in the past and are not unheard of in universities across the United States. In July 2019, a Florida-based business executive, Philip Esformes, faced indictment for bribing a basketball coach at the University of Pennsylvania to help his son get admitted to Penn. Another such scandal was unearthed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was disclosed that the university officials had favoured the admission of over 800 students in the class of 2005-2009. Such instances are proof of a broken system, as the 800 students favoured meant that 800 deserving students were denied the opportunity to obtain education at the institution. Similarly, a lawsuit against Harvard’s admission processes revealed the maintenance of a secret list of applicants by the college who are the kin of major donors of the university. The students on this donor list have a 42% acceptance rate against the overall 4.6% acceptance rate at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parenting, Cultural Capital and College Admissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;At the heart of the scandal lies a complex relationship between parenting, admissions, and cultural capital. In an article about the scandal in the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;, the term &quot;parenting on steroids&quot; was used in the article describing the process, synonymous with terms like intensive mothering. The notion behind this term was to explain a family complex that upper and middle-class parents seem to be grappling with to achieve certain standards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The constant fixation on attending a prestigious institution regardless of the child’s interest, in the name of holding social and parental status, is troublesome. The other cause of worry is the lack of belief in the child’s ability to earn admission into a college on their own. The parent, therefore, ends up playing a role in shielding their kids from disappointments rather than assisting them to become independent. Hence, the college process is seemingly harder on parents as it is a relentless test on what it means to be a good parent in the present time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;It is no secret that the scheme worked because of an education system that is broken. The 2019 college admissions scandal and the past episodes are all a result of structural inequality too. The elite schools are designed to favour the well-heeled. The US political and economic elites enjoy several advantages in the admission process, most of them legal! The students coming from families donating millions to the school are more likely to be considered. Further, over half of the private colleges and universities and a fraction of the public ones consider legacy admissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;There has also been a sharp rise in the number of private college counsellors, supporting the idea that higher education has become just another booming business where the wealthy have an upper hand. Similarly, SAT and ACT tutors are also common among those that are willing to pay. Therefore, even without the manipulation of test scores by people like Singer, the axis tilts heavily towards the affluent; as the students from this background can perform better in standardised tests in comparison to their peers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;A result is colleges and universities, including Ivy Leagues, being disproportionately populated by students from wealthy families. According to a 2017 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; analysis, there are more students from the top 1% of families by income against the bottom 60% at 38 colleges, including Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth and the University of Pennsylvania. Presumably, most of these admissions were bagged through years of leads that accrue from wealth: good education and test preparations, access to tutoring services, sports coaching and private lessons, and the absence of the tribulations that accompany poverty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Thus, American higher education in its entirety is just one big pay-to-play scheme making equal opportunity seem impossible to achieve. What is needed on the part of these elite universities is a reimagination of their objectives and the admission practices where one’s acceptance is not determined by their wealth or status, but pure merit. Along with that, the ethical lapses on the part of the parents to provide their kids with everything is essentially robbing them of skills that count. If the parents keep on pursuing their fixation with these handful of selective schools, there are going to be more such scandals in future. American higher education is not only supposed to prepare the best and the brightest generation of leaders, it is also supposed to nurture a principled foundation as the basis for its own existence.&lt;/p&gt;

Derived from the Latin term ‘luxus’, luxury is a state of extravagant living that serves little purpose in consumers’ lives except to fulfill dreams. And those dreams don’t come cheap. In that sense, luxury can be referred to as one end of the product continuum, where the beginning consists of basic, indispensable products and at the opposite extreme are the inessential but desirable luxury items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a necessity that begins when the necessity ends. Luxury has been a thriving business, particularly in the last two decades, and has grown into a €1 trillion sector encompassing automobiles, clothing, food, hospitality and even yachts - a small sector that still sparks people’s imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of luxury has evolved from rare pearls and spices in the 17th century to products of superior craftsmanship like Dior and Gucci during the 19th and early-20th century.&amp;nbsp; More recently, luxury has become an embodiment of those brands which go beyond the material and functionalities to offer a high degree of non-functional associations and invoke a world of scintillating fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, luxury is a complex phenomenon and very subjective in the sense that it often depends on the context that a consumer is situated in. What might be luxury for one, can be perceived as normal or even inferior by another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxury brands are purchased by consumers who seek to signal high levels of wealth and social status. People pursuing extrinsic aspirations tend to prefer luxury to reap the benefits stemming from refinement and a lavish lifestyle. These aspirations drive consumer behaviour towards the purchase of luxury goods for expressing economic superiority and enhancing self-esteem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extrinsic aspirations are never static and evolve to a higher level when one achieves the desired status. The perpetual restless ambition in each inferior class to elevate themselves to the status of those immediately above them causes fashionable luxury to spread like wildfire. Luxury brands are the access fee required to enter a restricted club of owners characterised by a sophisticated taste and sense of style for the prosperous consumers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Conspicuous Consumption Theory states that people who engage in conspicuous consumption often do so to emulate the scheme of life in vogue in the next higher stratum. Social emulation is generally publicly demonstrated since status is granted by the society. Through conspicuous logos and designs, the consumers feel that they virtually belong to the brand and hope that the aura of the designer of the brand also extends to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One dimension of luxury brands is functionality which comprises quality, aesthetics, rarity and history. Strict quality control is essential in the production of luxury goods to ensure longevity and provide the older generation with the pleasure to pass them on to their progeny. These products can get repaired and gain even greater value over time instead of ending up in the garbage. The aesthetic value of a product pertains to the amusement derived from seeing the product without consideration to whatever utilitarian function it might perform. When the product alternatives are similar in functioning and price, consumers refer to the aesthetic facet of colour, style and design that creates beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A luxury product is inspirational and desired for its enchanting imagery and the values and symbols that it conveys. The aura of a luxury product is due to its inaccessibility to the average consumer. Intensive distribution not only negates the idea of luxury, but also would conflict with the expectations of customers as the reputation of a luxury brand can get eroded if too many people own it. For instance, as soon as refrigerators or washing machines started getting produced on a large scale, they lost their status of being luxury items. Historically, rarity was caused due to the use of materials that were naturally scarce like gold and silver.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, today's rarity stems from the luxury incumbents’ trials to create artificial shortages, limited series and selective distribution in order to make the target group believe that they are elite and the brand is a part of their own identities. The most successful and renowned luxury brands have a long history that transports customers back to a mysterious and attractive period in the past. Although some younger brands like Armani and Versace have managed to enter the luxury universe, it is still vital for brands to build a sense of exclusivity around long family traditions to evoke lasting images in people’s hearts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another crucial dimension is that luxury brands need cult products that exude timelessness. Brands like Cartier and Tiffany often produce exceptional, unique pieces sold at extraordinary prices to create an instant buzz and thereby, harvest the benefits of fame and prestige. Fragile fashion businesses sell products at full prices as soon as the season begins, but they need to be heavily discounted as soon as the fashion fades away. Luxury brands overcome this socially constructed obsolescence of renewing wardrobes every year by creating classic pieces that are essentially the soul of luxury. Luxury requires time and luxury sells time. True luxury never offers rebates or discounts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradox of luxury marketing manifests itself most strongly in the premium pricing strategy. All products in the luxury niche are, without exception, exorbitant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high price automatically restricts access to luxury products and is justified in the consumer’s mind because of outstanding craftsmanship, technical excellence, and flawless service. Luxury customers do not shop based on price. Instead, they value the distinctive experience, design and quality. For them, price is not a measure of value, it rather creates value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, there has been a change in the ways luxury brands have targeted their consumer groups, from traditionally focussing on only the wealthiest consumers to now launching new product lines or product extensions aimed at targeting middle-class consumers. This trend is known as ‘Democratisation of Luxury’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, Marc Jacobs has opened their secondary line called Marc by Marc Jacobs, Balmain’s new product line is called Pierre Balmain and so on. These days luxury retailers are also collaborating with more affordable stores to offer a taste of their brand to the consumers in the middle of the wealth spectrum. For example, Versace, Stella McCartney and Karl Lagerfeld have collaborated with H&amp;amp;M to reach a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of increasing their volume, these luxury brands have successfully been able to nourish feelings of rarity and privilege by partnering with avant-garde artists to endow the limited collections with additional value so that purchasing priority becomes a competitive goal among the clientele.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Asia and Latin America, there has been a spurt in affluence and an upward trend in luxury consumption. Airports worldwide are transforming into luxury commercial hubs and provide an experience of the world of entitlement to travellers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly-rich consumers are zealous to enter the world of conspicuous consumption and pleasures, hoping to catch up with their Western counterparts. They have a greater desire to examine their emotional side and less guilt about spending money. Unlike patricians who had little need to demonstrate their status, these newly rich people crave attention and power that luxury brands can provide. They want their success to be visible in the form of palatial mansions and gorgeous vehicles. Their Lamborghinis and Ferraris do not stay in garages for they need to assert their superiority and fuel imitation desires in the society. The excursionists, that is, the ordinary people from the upper-middle class cannot buy penthouses or a Prada suit, but they might occasionally buy a small product such as a pair of socks from Armani or a watch from Ralph Lauren to satiate their hunger for desirability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luxury has drawn its own set of criticisms from communities all over the world. Luxury is evidence of a non-egalitarian society and betrayal of community values and therefore, attracts moral condemnation. Critics argue that intrinsic aspirations should be given a priority to curb materialism and hedonism. The Chinese government has banned luxury advertisement billboards on streets to avoid the blatant proof of the burgeoning gap between the haves and have-nots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A modern avatar of moral criticisms in the form of sustainable development has also sparked huge controversies. The advocates of sustainable development claim that sales of luxury products endanger rare species and ingredients while also promoting acrimony in society. The alternative argument is that luxury promotes true sustainability by lasting forever unlike fast fashion which gets dumped after the season or high-tech businesses that thrive on planned obsolescence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, luxury brands face many challenges. Counterfeit products are creating a price upheaval in the market since the same brand is available at a cheaper price. An increasing tendency is seen among the consumers to buy these lesser-priced goods associated with the same level of pride and stature.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of the internet and social media has given free access to bloggers and influencers to evaluate the products and services and portray the brands according to personal judgements. Luxury brands thus get compared with mass-market brands based on the number of likes and followers on social media or the number of products sold on eBay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus is gradually shifting from fancy details of a traditional luxury product to brand principles and conscious intent. Businesses need to demonstrate authenticity in all touch points and focus on diversity and inclusivity. The new luxury consumer is mindful and so the brands need to understand his motivational factors towards their products in order to develop better marketing strategies and navigate the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abhinav Gupta</name></author><category term="business-finance" /><summary type="html">Luxury is an enigmatic and elusive concept.

That, to the degree of 100, is the sensitivity of today’s internet, and well, more specifically, the stock market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised the stock market's reactivity to news when I first participated in a mock stock, and thought “&lt;em&gt;So it’s just an exaggerated version of how the stock market reacts to news&lt;/em&gt;”. Turns out, it’s not so exaggerated. Because if Elon Musk tweeting out a meme can sway the market, then anything can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article deals with how sensitive the stock market can be to seemingly useless pieces of information and how that may have amplified due to COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the Stock Market become a Joke?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market is Elon Musk’s world and we’re just trading in it. Wonder why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 1, 2021, Musk tweeted, “&lt;em&gt;Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.. Baby Doge, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo.. Baby Doge&lt;/em&gt;”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t scratch your heads trying to find a deeper meaning, for it’s exactly as it sounds. After the tweet, Dogecoin surged 3%, while more interestingly, Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, plunged nearly 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers Mr Markus and Jackson Palmer co-created Dogecoin as a joke in 2013. It is mainly based on the Doge meme that swept the Internet in the same year (and has now created a monopoly in WhatsApp sticker collections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Musk once expressed his interest in the coin, saying, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Doge barking at the stars&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; and the price of Dogecoin soared by 20%. It’s called the ‘&lt;em&gt;Musk Effect&lt;/em&gt;’. If you scroll through Elon Musk’s Twitter account, you’ll find an array of Doge memes that have gone on to move markets. The meme cryptocurrency once even became the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An episode that shook the stock market- The GameStop Incident!! One day, retail investors on Reddit decided that (i) the short sellers were evil, (ii) punishing them would cause the stock to sky-rocket, and (iii) this would all be pretty funny. So the stock peaked at $483.00, which is 185.7% above the current share price. And mind you, the current price itself is grossly overvalued. Honestly, why wouldn’t it be? After all, GameStop is a meme stock (a stock that sees dramatic price increases, mostly fueled by people on social media, primarily Reddit, Twitter and Tik Tok).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s delve into practicalities. It’s humanly impossible to follow the news religiously, so how exactly does the impact intensify?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter HFT. High-frequency trading (HFT) is an automated trading platform that large investment and trading parties (like hedge funds, investment banks, and institutional investors) employ. It uses powerful computers to analyse the markets and spot emerging trends in a fraction of a second.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being able to recognise such shifts, the trading systems send hundreds of baskets of stocks out into the marketplace at bid-ask spreads that are advantageous to the traders. For context, a bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do these computer programmes do this? According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://business.time.com/2013/04/24/how-does-one-fake-tweet-cause-a-stock-market-crash/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Irene Aldrige&lt;/a&gt;, Managing Partner at ABLE Alpha Trading, high-frequency traders compile a list of news sources like Stock Exchange Commission filings, business publications, and social media platforms like Twitter, and tell their computer programmes to skim through those sources looking for specific keywords (like ‘bankruptcy’ or ‘merger’) that signal something about the market.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can a fake tweet cause a stock market crash? Potentially, yes. But these bots are programmed to filter through so much information that in the grand scheme of things, these methods prove more advantageous than inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my point is, &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is moving?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meme stocks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is moving them?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memes (or computer systems)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these incidents make one question if we’re all just pretending that investing and trading is as calculative and artful as it seems? Because if Elon Musk’s tweets or some stranger Redditors can randomly decide for me the value of my investments, then why the hell am I wasting my time on Fundamental and Technical Analyses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pandemic and the Instability of the Stock Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know about Cristiano Ronaldo’s Coca Cola fiasco. For those who don’t: he arbitrarily removed two bottles of Coca-Cola during a press conference at the Euro 2020, while asking for them to be replaced by water. The video gained a lot of traction. It inspired at least five more such moments across the world. Overall, it was pretty funny.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you see, it wasn’t funny for Coca Cola, because in the aftermath, the giant suffered a staggering loss of $4 billion. The story seems pretty nonsensical to me, but it sure makes me wonder if things would have panned out the same way if it weren’t for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is research that asserts the stock market has been more sensitive to the news during the COVID pandemic than otherwise. Just like us, humans! For instance, the findings of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12559-021-09819-8#Sec12&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comparative study&lt;/a&gt; confirm that the drop in stock prices during the COVID-19 era was more dramatic than the Swine Flu period, because of the presence of more speculation, rumours and negative news.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another plausible reason for this could be that our existence has been shifting online minute-by-minute, during the pandemic. What’s virtual, seems real. So any piece of news online is more impactful than it would have been in normalcy. In other words, it’s harder to filter out what news would have had a bearing on your investing decisions pre-COVID and what news wouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, it’s no secret that investors detest uncertainty. The pandemic has tossed onto us a record-breaking, all-time high of unpredictability, and that had to materialise as overly-sensitive stock market indices and traders, some time or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these are just hypotheses, only time can tell us if we will ever recover from this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is Sensitivity Important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now it’s clear that it is important to acknowledge that sometimes, the stock market can be a little crazy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But still, sensitivity is important. If people want to invest mindlessly, let them exercise their choice too. It sends a signal to the government and monopolists, that if the people are wronged, in the way of faulty policies or immoral corporate behaviour, consequences will follow, and the economy will tumble. And if every once in a while, we happen to observe notorious stock market activity, prices will readjust and bounce back to their intrinsic value.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To conclude, sensitive stock markets are like a well-functioning democracy. Which is to say, as long as the common people in it have the power to bring the entire system down, we’re doing okay. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eeshita Verma</name></author><category term="business-finance" /><summary type="html">Have you ever felt that sudden chill that runs down your spine when you bite on that ice cream too hard?

They brought with them a momentary respite and distraction from the overbearing pandemic and the disconcerting healthcare crisis around the world. The much anticipated Euro Cup 2020 was the highlight of this summer, with new records being made and new players and teams taking the centre stage after what seemed like a long wait.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those two hours at night, people across the world would leave their chores, rush through dinner or complete assignments in haste so that they could give their undivided attention to the game. For those few hours, they would forget about their surroundings and become one with the spirit of the game and diffuse with the energy in the room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It almost works like alchemy, the allure of sports. As someone who started watching football not so long ago, I have come to two deductions. Firstly, the 20 long years of my life wherein I did not take out enough time for sports have been wasted on the endorphins I could have brimmed with. Secondly, sports, especially football is a festival of emotions for which you do not need expert knowledge or an undying allegiance to a team to enjoy but simply a fervour to follow it through till the end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to appreciate this game for what it is - a collection of moments that are so fleeting that you have no time to waste on temporal matters but focus wholeheartedly on the game. You sit down in front of a big screen with a tub of popcorn and a cold beverage (pro tip: avoid hot drinks in and around a room where a feisty match is on the go) and for the next two hours you forget about the deadlines, or a fight with your partner, or your family’s daily dysfunctionality, and even maybe that you're amid a pandemic and that life has come to a standstill for the most part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those two hours, you do not take it one day at a time, you do not take deep breaths and think about how the pieces of your life will fall into place, but you dive deep as all the bets are off. You feel like you’re going through a ridge of crests and troughs, but you don't mind the troughs because those little moments, good or bad, is what sums up the experience of this sport into something wholesome. It is somehow okay even through the lows because you risked it all when you started to watch the game- accepting its outcome for the sheer journey of it all. It is sufficient to say that it is therapeutic to see those players make their lives’ commitment and devotion come alive in a matter of seconds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey of a spectator is anything but linear for the period of a football match - it is chaotic and intense. To think of the journey of the players - out on the field, flowing, flying, heaving and yearning has to be an enigmatic experience - one that we can only speculate, assess and discuss but never actualise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final of the Euros was a pivotal event for both Italy and England. Italy went from plummeting to their bottom in 2018 when they did not even qualify for the World Cup to successfully lifting the championship trophy of Euro Cup 2020. Historical giants of the footballing world not qualifying for the World Cup of 2018 was as close to sacrilege for their team and Italy's fans as it could've been.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy lost its zeal, some players retired and some just left due to the backlash that they faced from their fans and their counterparts. Italy went through their worst phase brought about by a lack of driven players, direction, ideology, and dismal management. Until they found their way back to their calling, led by their manager Roberto Mancini who turned their trajectory by 180 degrees, back toward their ascent. With his tactics and shrewd man-management, he ignited the dying fire and passion in those players, manifested in their unmatched grit and determination during the Euro 2020 season.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When no one expected anything from Italy, they changed the face of the game, their retired players came back to fight and they proved to be the dark horses of the season. It was a historic and beautiful victory for Italy, finally after all their hard work. It was a classic case of rising from the ashes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As important as this victory was for Italy, it was also a watershed game for England who made it to the finals for the first time in 60 years, since the Cup commenced their games in 1960. For a team who hadn't even made it to the finals before, this was a glorious moment for them to 'bring it home’ as the world chanted on. England had reached the semi-finals and quarter-finals in the previous years but never made it past that, losing quite a few games during the penalty shoot-outs in those instances. Thus, one can imagine how terribly fraught this moment must have been for the players badged with the three lions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened during the penalty shoot out was unfortunate for England due to their history with penalties and the pressure of the moment, but what happened after the match was even more pitiful - the backlash and violence at the stadium by the English fans, who publicly booed the Italian national anthem first and then caused a ruckus with policemen and other supporters in a post-match rage. Racist slurs were hurled at the three players who missed the penalty shootout. Bukayo Saka, 19 (one of the youngest players on the England squad), Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho were the three players who were subjected to unfairly carrying on the burden of England’s defeat and faced the brunt of the English audience’s racist and insensitive reaction. It goes on to show the ignorance and bias still entrenched in people’s minds about race. Makes you wonder if all the acceptance is just a perfunctory act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is by no means justified to have to face the kind of abuse that these players did, even if they missed the penalty. It is easy to rebuke sportspersons for missing a shot but what the spectators don't realise is the trepidation that is induced by these heavy moments of &lt;em&gt;do or die&lt;/em&gt;, where one shot of yours will decide the fate of not just your team but your entire country. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://believeperform.com/the-effect-of-anxiety-on-world-cup-penalty-shootouts/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;, such moments in a penalty shootout may lead to footballers experiencing symptoms of anxiety. Some commonly occurring symptoms are increases in muscle tension affecting coordination and an increase in heart rate and sweating. Psychologically, anxiety can cause concentration changes such as loss of awareness due to mental tension or poor selective perception. The weakening physiological and attentional changes that occur are the factors that can lead to ‘choking’ in the moment. Imagine your stage fright or nervousness in a new social situation and multiply that by a hundred and maybe then you'll begin to fathom the mental state of a person in such a situation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rashford faced a deluge of slander on his Instagram and people went so far ahead as to even destroy his mural in his own home country, a country wherein he excelled not just in football but even outside the field. This is a man who has done so much good for society and even received The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire award for his efforts to tackle food poverty among vulnerable children, especially during the pandemic.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that it matters that he did all of this, even if he hadn’t, there is no cop-out for the abuse. But this is to say how racial abuse still affects one’s life. Wherever you reach, however much you do, the so-called ‘privileged’ race, class, or gender will always find ways to bring you down. The xenophobic and rowdy behaviour of the English fans was abhorrent in ways ineffable. Even though these racist remarks were received with intolerance and chide from many people across the world, who stood with these players through staunch social media support and protests near Rashford’s mural, we are still far from the response these players and many others deserve from the world football community and association. This is just one case that came to light because of the enormity of the game's scale, but such petty racism is still prevalent in every corner of this world's football fields. To not let another Rashford, Saka or Sancho feel this disparaged and harassed, the world needs to put their foot down and refuse to tolerate such immature cowards in the guise of bullies. &lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Poorvi Gupta</name></author><category term="society" /><summary type="html">The months of June and July provided a shade from the exhaustion of the lockdown in the guise of various sporting events, ironically, despite being the hottest months of the year.

Pride month is and was, indeed, a month full of people taking &lt;em&gt;pride &lt;/em&gt;in who they are and pride parades are a sight to behold. However, this article is not a fairytale painting a happy picture of the month but rather explores its dark side, i.e. rainbow washing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would scroll through the LinkedIn profiles of a big, or as a matter-of-fact, any company during the month of June, it would not be hard to notice that most of them have rainbows slapped on their logos. Isn't it something to be happy about? After all, this is a sign of increasing acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community by society. If the previous two sentences outlined your thought process, then it reinforces the importance of awareness about rainbow washing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting with rainbow washing, it is important to understand another terminology associated with it that is 'pink money'. Pink money refers to the purchasing power of LGBTQ+ community. The 'pink' here is a reference to the pink triangle which was used as a badge in Nazi concentration camps to identify homosexuals. When the gay rights community became active it took it as a symbol to identify their movement and till date it serves as a strong symbol of their struggles. According to the sources, the LGBT population accounts for 5-10% of the total population. If it were a country, the community could claim to have the fourth-largest GDP in the world, estimated at $4.6 trillion. Now, a lot of corporations can and do go out of their way to monetise this 'pink money'. Here's where rainbow washing comes into the picture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rainbow washing refers to the practice of supporting LGBTQ issues in public to gather an audience while having private policies that are detrimental for them. To put it in simple words, corporations put rainbows on their logos, products and icons to tap the LGBTQ+ markets. Though when it comes to issues such as recruiting and helping them concretely, the companies back out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey found that about 50% of people belonging to this group believed being out at work would end up hurting their careers. During pride month, this year, Lego launched its special series titled 'Everybody is awesome' adorned in rainbow colours and priced it at $30, with it being a limited edition. Most other big brands such as Apple came up with products specifically targeted towards this segment intending to donate the proceeds generated through these sales towards organisations working for the betterment of the community. However, the past records tell a different story. A large part of this revenue is never actually spent on the betterment of the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rainbow washing may seem like a pretty marketing tactic or a petty issue but it has a lot of detrimental effects on the existence of pride. The commodification and monetisation of an event like pride end up demeaning the struggles and identity of the community celebrating it. As opposed to being a month of acceptance and love, pride turns into a month of closing business deals and getting traction for your product. A majority of people from the community said that rainbow washing made them feel uncomfortable about their identity. The fact that their coming out or acceptance is being reduced to a marketing tactic makes them feel used.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If business conglomerates actually want to support the cause and fight for the community, they should indeed open up employment opportunities or destigmatize the talk around LGBTQ+ issues. Most of them are just trying to tap into the 'pink money' while the people are left behind. Their economic condition is not robust and at a lot of places, they are not even allowed to enter a shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, looking at the flip side of rainbow washing, the symbolism has helped spread awareness about the issue in the marginalised or backward communities. The advertisements during pride month do provide a lot of opportunities to the people of the community. Although again, the phenomenon is not year-round. Hence, the opportunities end up being more like a company-influencer relationship rather than being a company-employee relationship. As soon as the pride month starts coming to an end, the support and charisma behind these rainbow coloured logos starts fading and so does the love and acceptance bestowed upon the community by the corporates. Life for them returns to normalcy with all its struggles and rocky roads, and the community for them seems long forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Shiksha Mody</name></author><category term="society" /><summary type="html">The month of June is coloured with colours of solidarity, determination and struggles of the LGBTQ+ community.

And yet, for all the satisfaction these new forms brought with them, the music remained the heart of this global phenomenon. Despite the pandemic’s impact on the worldwide recording industry, releases from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/entertainer-of-the-year-2020-bts/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;saw no decline in quantity or quality, and a slew of artists produced their best work to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The K-pop songs and albums that defined the year transported us to places we miss most—from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5912807/best-broadway-shows-to-stream/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the theat&lt;/a&gt;re&amp;nbsp;to the jazz bar to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5870462/rick-steves-coronavirus-quarantine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;island vacation&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that lives only in our memories or imaginations. Some prompted nostalgia for things we&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5902420/hugging-coronavirus-amy-ephron/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;once took for granted&lt;/a&gt;, while others inspired hope for their return. Through these releases, many of our favorite artists experimented with their sounds, all while building deeper connections with an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5912998/bts-army/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;audience&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;they could only interact with from a distance. A talented rookie class experimented with retro sounds, while K-pop's most successful women brazenly defied expectations. Disco completely took over, and noise music prevailed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also a year for career breakthroughs and major milestones, as the world's biggest superstars&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.papermag.com/tag/bts&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BTS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;continued to shatter records left and right and break new ground for Korean artists. They're going into the new year with three number-one singles on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hot 100, a whole quarantine album, and a Grammy nomination. And while the world got smaller, K-pop went bigger and bolder — sonically and aesthetically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the global coronavirus pandemic put an end to live touring, the K-pop industry brought the spectacle to our screens with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/k-pop-future-of-live-music-immersive-online-concerts&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;immersive live concert&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;experiences. The music never stopped, not even for a second&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a casual listener, a stan, or someone who's just genuinely curious to see what K-pop is all about,&amp;nbsp;here are 10 songs from the heat of KPOP that made the hard 2020 much easier and eventually took the world by storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1)&lt;strong&gt; BTS, 'Black Swan' (&lt;em&gt;Map of the Soul: 7&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BTS has connected with a worldwide fanbase in large part thanks to the universal-but-still-personal themes of their music, and 'Black Swan' represents one of their most intimate confessions. Dreamy, gloomy hip-hop soundscapes lay the backdrop for the chart-toppers to open up about their darkest fears: that they may one day fall out of love with music. Using the title as a metaphor – to represent both the one-of-a-kind phenomenon they are and the 2010 movie where a ballerina makes the ultimate sacrifice for her art – the superstar septet investigates their underlying anxieties whilst declaring that they won’t let fear win over passion in the end. It’s a full-fledged motion picture-packed into just over three minutes to tell a rare, real-life story of one of the world’s biggest stars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2)&lt;strong&gt; TXT, 'Can’t You See Me' (&lt;em&gt;The Dream Chapter: ETERNITY&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 'Can’t You See Me' TXT pulls the dark undercurrent of their youthful whimsy out from under the bed. Crunchy electric guitars and a jaunty whistle add a refreshing contrast to the track’s trap underpinnings, but where it best exposes its murkiness is through the quintet's vocal performances. Alternating between distorted tremolo vocals, hushed whisper-raps, and delicate verses wisping like curls of smoke, the members’ voices lurch between dulcet and disorienting as they reveal the cracks in a friendship. Through unsettling sounds and an idyllic music video that devolves into something frightening, TXT lay bare a horror rarely spoken of: watching a friendship fade before your eyes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3)&lt;strong&gt; &amp;nbsp;Twice, “I CAN’T STOP ME” (&lt;em&gt;Eyes Wide Open)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga, Twice were hip to electro basslines this year in “I CAN’T STOP ME.” The girl group bask in the elastic, strobing synth that pulses under the glamorous nu-disco track, and it snaps into formation with the chorus. The song calls for a grand celebration, but they’re too distracted trying not to indulge in their own treacherous desires: “I just can’t go back anymore/ Out of control,” Chaeyoung sings before the rest of the group fully surrender to temptation. Twice fight to keep cool, though it’s hard to notice when they nail such a spotless performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) WOODZ, “BUMP BUMP” (&lt;em&gt;WOOPS!&lt;/em&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great year for soloists in K-pop, and no one was more honest with themselves than WOODZ. The push-and-pull of any romance is often the most enticing yet stressful aspect of it all. Amidst airy promises from his lover is the dreary prospect of being left alone, but he approaches this mixed-messaging with a refreshing candour. In our own whirlpools of flirting and call backs, IG-reels and missed messages, “BUMP BUMP” was comfortingly straightforward – with WOODZ relaying what he wants, exactly how he wants it. It was the wrong year to be young and in love in 2020, but at least we had WOODZ to keep us company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Weki Meki, “COOL” (&lt;em&gt;NEW RULES&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weki Meki revamp their approach in 'Cool' by swapping their preppy dance-pop for steely electro. The group’s demeanor is as spartan as the icy beat, and they amplify their bratty voices to assert their flawlessness. Their cockiness peaks in the chorus, which doubles as a taunt and a mantra: &quot;Be hotter/ Beyond the control,” they sing like a drill instructor. “Get out of all the boring rules.” If “Cool” sounds standoffish, then the song succeeds at what it sets out to do. Weki Meki don’t aspire to be a role model for attainable, girl-crush cool but instead point out the gap between you and them. “Cool” is a conceited celebration of self, though sometimes it just feels satisfying to flaunt what you got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6). GFRIEND, 'MAGO' (&lt;em&gt;回:Walpurgis Night&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'MAGO' distils disco to its very best qualities, shimmering – quite literally – with synths and steady beats, building a heady, atmospheric high. As cohesive as it is musically, its magic lies in how perfectly it fits into the ethos of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;回:Walpurgis Night.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;The album&amp;nbsp;is built on the idea of modern witches, at the centre of which are women who exercise the same agency and power of the song’s namesake, and GFRIEND has fun while doing it. Interspersed with images of the girls dancing the night away – not what you’d expect from a concept dealing with the occult – are lyrics that brim with confidence and ambition. Instead of believing in fairy tales and waiting for a Prince Charming, their only love is the images of themselves smiling in the mirror. It’s a cheeky way to poke fun at how society perceives self-assured women since the title itself translates to 'wizard.' In celebrating their limitless ambition, 'MAGO' casts a spell that keeps you coming back for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) SEVENTEEN, 'Left &amp;amp; Right' (&lt;em&gt;Heng:garæ&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'LEFT &amp;amp; RIGHT' is so exuberant that every sound – from doorbell chimes to 808 cowbells, organ synth riffs to full-bodied brass&amp;nbsp; –&amp;nbsp; bursts forth like aural confetti. One could readily claim SEVENTEEN have made their own 'Cupid Shuffle' but they’re aiming for something beyond mere dance instructional: this is a song for transforming every moment into a cause for celebration. In a time when in-person parties aren’t possible, 'LEFT &amp;amp; RIGHT' converts bedrooms into dancefloors. And with exultant shouts and energized rapping, they tell you to keep your chin up, to run down red carpets, to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt;. SEVENTEEN act as leaders and hype men here, but the role they fill best is that of life coaches: despite their talk of races and finish lines, they exclaim that “not running is an answer too / who cares what we do.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They grant permission to simply be: a reminder that surviving every day is enough right now. And after all, if you’re not moving forward, why not move &quot;LEFT &amp;amp; RIGHT,”&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;? They understand something that should be taught in schools around the world: busting your ass should be supplemented with time spent shaking it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) Apink, 'Dumhdurum' (&lt;em&gt;LOOK&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K-pop tends to be a young person's game – both the industry and its labels regularly shift their priorities to younger artists – but Apink’s 'Dumhdurum' makes an exceptional case for the continuing effort and investment in senior acts. The track opens with a swirling synth-pop hook strong enough to stand as a chorus on its own, before diving into verses and choruses that strike pop gold with just the right amount of catchy repetition and melancholy longing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apink detail the complexity of remaining calm in the presence of a past love, even when one’s heart's still beating&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;dumhdurum&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;for them – a concept that could be difficult for younger groups to believably pull off. This mature message successfully connected with a large audience, and 'Dumhdurum' became a knockout success in both Korea (topping all local music charts) and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;charts (tying for their longest-running hit on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.billboard.com/charts/world-digital-song-sales&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Digital Song Sales&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine years into their career, Apink are still more than equipped to bring their A-Game, and that deserves larger recognition all in itself for the industry to pay equal attention to both its senior and developing artists. Matured musical magic awaits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9). EVERGLOW, 'LA DI DA' (&lt;em&gt;-77.82x-78.29&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a virtual flattening of borders, musical trends in the States now get reflected in&amp;nbsp;K-pop in real-time. Throughout 2020 – in both the U.S. and South Korea – throwback sounds were ubiquitous. This year’s K-pop magnum opus, EVERGLOW’s 'LA DI DA' mirrored the US’ pop magnum opus, The Weeknd’s 'Blinding Lights' only months after its release. But where The Weeknd’s work is chilling and sinister in its search for love, EVERGLOW’s is a spry kiss-off to all the haters, the bad guys, and the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful pastiche of the 80's that’s crafted by producer Ollipop, 'LA DI DA' blends myriad influences: the&amp;nbsp;layered cheerleader chants of Toni Basil's '&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aqLwHP4y6Q&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mickey&lt;/a&gt;' the spunky girl power of Cyndi Lauper and the Go-Go's, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnYWmgSZdlM&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;na-na-nas&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of Bananarama, and above all, the shimmering synth-pop sound that permeated the top half of that decade. 'LA DI DA' melds these all together, with K-pop twists: a killing part punctuated by handclaps, a tempo-shifting rap section carried by leader E:U, and an earworm of a melody evocative of early 2010's K-pop – a time when choruses were packed with hooky vocal melodies instead of hollow drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) 'Lovesick Girls', BLACKPINK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrival of BLACKPINK’s first&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5896487/blackpink-the-album/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;full-length album&lt;/a&gt; — so highly anticipated at the project was simply titled&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Album&lt;/em&gt;—was one of K-pop’s biggest news events in 2020. While the pre-release singles&amp;nbsp;'&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5859277/blackpink-how-you-like-that/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How You Like That&lt;/a&gt;'&amp;nbsp;and 'Ice Cream' with Selena Gomez charted higher on the &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; Hot 100, 'Lovesick Girls' is the true gem on the album. The heavy electronic production characteristic of BLACKPINK’s crowd-riling bops remains intact, but it’s stripped back to accentuate sung melodies from the four members. Their voices are layered over an acoustic guitar to create a breezy and mellow ambience, taking a more pensive and melancholic turn from the hard-hitting nature of the group’s 2018 and 2019 title track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While 2020 has been far from a banner year for K-pop, with the coronavirus pandemic impacting the industry through disbandments, cancelled tours, and shelved comebacks, there have been enough pleasant surprises to keep fans plugged in. BTS’ success these days can make it hard to recall that they were once considered the underdogs of the K-pop industry. The seven-piece group didn’t come from a big management firm, and at the time of their debut, they stood out for not sounding (or looking) overly packaged or produced. Instead, BTS was built by their fans — the 'Army' — who rallied behind the group. This month, the Army’s influence has extended beyond music and into social justice, when the loyal fanbase helped to match the group’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bts-black-lives-matter-donation-1011198/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$1 million donation to Black Lives Matter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That followed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/white-lives-matter-k-pop-1009581/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;coordinated campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by K-pop fans just days earlier, when fans came together to drown out the racist #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag on Twitter by spamming it with irreverent memes and fan cams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For anyone who still thought K-pop was a passing fad or a niche subset best left to the 'world music' fringes, the recent rallying of the fandoms (not to mention a host of spirited new releases) has underlined the fact that K-pop is more than just another overseas import — it’s officially a global force.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tejasvi Joshi</name></author><category term="culture" /><summary type="html">This year, K-pop accelerated its expansion into all sorts of mediums — novels,&amp;nbsp;podcasts,&amp;nbsp;documentaries.

Alternating between distorted tremolo vocals, hushed whisper-raps, and delicate verses wisping like curls of smoke, the members’ voices lurch between dulcet and disorienting as they reveal the cracks in a friendship. Through unsettling sounds and an idyllic music video that devolves into something frightening, TXT lay bare a horror rarely spoken of: watching a friendship fade before your eyes 3) &amp;nbsp;Twice, “I CAN’T STOP ME” (Eyes Wide Open) Like Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga, Twice were hip to electro basslines this year in “I CAN’T STOP ME.” The girl group bask in the elastic, strobing synth that pulses under the glamorous nu-disco track, and it snaps into formation with the chorus. The song calls for a grand celebration, but they’re too distracted trying not to indulge in their own treacherous desires: “I just can’t go back anymore/ Out of control,” Chaeyoung sings before the rest of the group fully surrender to temptation. Twice fight to keep cool, though it’s hard to notice when they nail such a spotless performance. 4) WOODZ, “BUMP BUMP” (WOOPS!)&amp;nbsp; This was a great year for soloists in K-pop, and no one was more honest with themselves than WOODZ. The push-and-pull of any romance is often the most enticing yet stressful aspect of it all. Amidst airy promises from his lover is the dreary prospect of being left alone, but he approaches this mixed-messaging with a refreshing candour. In our own whirlpools of flirting and call backs, IG-reels and missed messages, “BUMP BUMP” was comfortingly straightforward – with WOODZ relaying what he wants, exactly how he wants it. It was the wrong year to be young and in love in 2020, but at least we had WOODZ to keep us company. 5) Weki Meki, “COOL” (NEW RULES) Weki Meki revamp their approach in 'Cool' by swapping their preppy dance-pop for steely electro. The group’s demeanor is as spartan as the icy beat, and they amplify their bratty voices to assert their flawlessness. Their cockiness peaks in the chorus, which doubles as a taunt and a mantra: &quot;Be hotter/ Beyond the control,” they sing like a drill instructor. “Get out of all the boring rules.” If “Cool” sounds standoffish, then the song succeeds at what it sets out to do. Weki Meki don’t aspire to be a role model for attainable, girl-crush cool but instead point out the gap between you and them. “Cool” is a conceited celebration of self, though sometimes it just feels satisfying to flaunt what you got. 6). GFRIEND, 'MAGO' (回:Walpurgis Night) 'MAGO' distils disco to its very best qualities, shimmering – quite literally – with synths and steady beats, building a heady, atmospheric high. As cohesive as it is musically, its magic lies in how perfectly it fits into the ethos of&amp;nbsp;回:Walpurgis Night.&amp;nbsp;The album&amp;nbsp;is built on the idea of modern witches, at the centre of which are women who exercise the same agency and power of the song’s namesake, and GFRIEND has fun while doing it. Interspersed with images of the girls dancing the night away – not what you’d expect from a concept dealing with the occult – are lyrics that brim with confidence and ambition. Instead of believing in fairy tales and waiting for a Prince Charming, their only love is the images of themselves smiling in the mirror. It’s a cheeky way to poke fun at how society perceives self-assured women since the title itself translates to 'wizard.' In celebrating their limitless ambition, 'MAGO' casts a spell that keeps you coming back for more. 7) SEVENTEEN, 'Left &amp;amp; Right' (Heng:garæ) 'LEFT &amp;amp; RIGHT' is so exuberant that every sound – from doorbell chimes to 808 cowbells, organ synth riffs to full-bodied brass&amp;nbsp; –&amp;nbsp; bursts forth like aural confetti. One could readily claim SEVENTEEN have made their own 'Cupid Shuffle' but they’re aiming for something beyond mere dance instructional: this is a song for transforming every moment into a cause for celebration. In a time when in-person parties aren’t possible, 'LEFT &amp;amp; RIGHT' converts bedrooms into dancefloors. And with exultant shouts and energized rapping, they tell you to keep your chin up, to run down red carpets, to&amp;nbsp;dance. SEVENTEEN act as leaders and hype men here, but the role they fill best is that of life coaches: despite their talk of races and finish lines, they exclaim that “not running is an answer too / who cares what we do.”&amp;nbsp; They grant permission to simply be: a reminder that surviving every day is enough right now. And after all, if you’re not moving forward, why not move &quot;LEFT &amp;amp; RIGHT,”&amp;nbsp;right? They understand something that should be taught in schools around the world: busting your ass should be supplemented with time spent shaking it.&amp;nbsp; 8) Apink, 'Dumhdurum' (LOOK) K-pop tends to be a young person's game – both the industry and its labels regularly shift their priorities to younger artists – but Apink’s 'Dumhdurum' makes an exceptional case for the continuing effort and investment in senior acts. The track opens with a swirling synth-pop hook strong enough to stand as a chorus on its own, before diving into verses and choruses that strike pop gold with just the right amount of catchy repetition and melancholy longing. Apink detail the complexity of remaining calm in the presence of a past love, even when one’s heart's still beating&amp;nbsp;dumhdurum&amp;nbsp;for them – a concept that could be difficult for younger groups to believably pull off. This mature message successfully connected with a large audience, and 'Dumhdurum' became a knockout success in both Korea (topping all local music charts) and the&amp;nbsp;Billboard&amp;nbsp;charts (tying for their longest-running hit on&amp;nbsp;World Digital Song Sales).&amp;nbsp; Nine years into their career, Apink are still more than equipped to bring their A-Game, and that deserves larger recognition all in itself for the industry to pay equal attention to both its senior and developing artists. Matured musical magic awaits. 9). EVERGLOW, 'LA DI DA' (-77.82x-78.29) Thanks to a virtual flattening of borders, musical trends in the States now get reflected in&amp;nbsp;K-pop in real-time. Throughout 2020 – in both the U.S. and South Korea – throwback sounds were ubiquitous. This year’s K-pop magnum opus, EVERGLOW’s 'LA DI DA' mirrored the US’ pop magnum opus, The Weeknd’s 'Blinding Lights' only months after its release. But where The Weeknd’s work is chilling and sinister in its search for love, EVERGLOW’s is a spry kiss-off to all the haters, the bad guys, and the players. A successful pastiche of the 80's that’s crafted by producer Ollipop, 'LA DI DA' blends myriad influences: the&amp;nbsp;layered cheerleader chants of Toni Basil's 'Mickey' the spunky girl power of Cyndi Lauper and the Go-Go's, the&amp;nbsp;na-na-nas&amp;nbsp;of Bananarama, and above all, the shimmering synth-pop sound that permeated the top half of that decade. 'LA DI DA' melds these all together, with K-pop twists: a killing part punctuated by handclaps, a tempo-shifting rap section carried by leader E:U, and an earworm of a melody evocative of early 2010's K-pop – a time when choruses were packed with hooky vocal melodies instead of hollow drops. 10) 'Lovesick Girls', BLACKPINK The arrival of BLACKPINK’s first&amp;nbsp;full-length album — so highly anticipated at the project was simply titled&amp;nbsp;The Album—was one of K-pop’s biggest news events in 2020. While the pre-release singles&amp;nbsp;'How You Like That'&amp;nbsp;and 'Ice Cream' with Selena Gomez charted higher on the Billboard Hot 100, 'Lovesick Girls' is the true gem on the album. The heavy electronic production characteristic of BLACKPINK’s crowd-riling bops remains intact, but it’s stripped back to accentuate sung melodies from the four members. Their voices are layered over an acoustic guitar to create a breezy and mellow ambience, taking a more pensive and melancholic turn from the hard-hitting nature of the group’s 2018 and 2019 title track. While 2020 has been far from a banner year for K-pop, with the coronavirus pandemic impacting the industry through disbandments, cancelled tours, and shelved comebacks, there have been enough pleasant surprises to keep fans plugged in. BTS’ success these days can make it hard to recall that they were once considered the underdogs of the K-pop industry. The seven-piece group didn’t come from a big management firm, and at the time of their debut, they stood out for not sounding (or looking) overly packaged or produced. Instead, BTS was built by their fans — the 'Army' — who rallied behind the group. This month, the Army’s influence has extended beyond music and into social justice, when the loyal fanbase helped to match the group’s&amp;nbsp;$1 million donation to Black Lives Matter. That followed a&amp;nbsp;coordinated campaign&amp;nbsp;by K-pop fans just days earlier, when fans came together to drown out the racist #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag on Twitter by spamming it with irreverent memes and fan cams. For anyone who still thought K-pop was a passing fad or a niche subset best left to the 'world music' fringes, the recent rallying of the fandoms (not to mention a host of spirited new releases) has underlined the fact that K-pop is more than just another overseas import — it’s officially a global force.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Not Tying the Knot in Korea</title><link href="/Not-Tying-the-Knot-in-Korea" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Not Tying the Knot in Korea" /><published>2021-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-07-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/Not-Tying-the-Knot-in-Korea</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Not-Tying-the-Knot-in-Korea">&lt;p&gt;Korea's value for marriage can be recognised from the popular saying: &quot;&lt;em&gt;A person becomes an adult only after marriage&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which is broadly used in the country. This reveals that the culture often sees being married as the equivalent of being an adult. Moreover, there is the obvious influence of Confucianism in South Korea which considers marriage to be essential for maintaining bloodlines.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Sampo&amp;nbsp;Generation (&amp;nbsp;삼포세대 ) however, disagrees.&amp;nbsp;Sampo&amp;nbsp;Generation, which literally translates to 'giving up on three, generation' is the younger generation of the country who are giving up on dating, marriage and having children. If we look at the statistics over the last three decades (1981-2011), the average age of marriage for South Korean women has increased by six years (23.0 to 29.1), a year more than it has for men (26.4 to 31.9). Furthermore, there has also been a drastic increase in single households (9% in 1990 to 26% in 2013). What are the factors that have led to such an increase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea, as a society,&amp;nbsp;stereotypically&amp;nbsp;preferred sons to daughters. While daughters were prepared for their future roles as mothers and wives, education for women was not thought to be as important as it was for men. However, there were also social groups like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Gisaeng&lt;/em&gt;s.&amp;nbsp;The &lt;em&gt;Gisaeng&lt;/em&gt;s first appeared in the&amp;nbsp;Goryeo&amp;nbsp;Dynasty (918-1392) and were often historically misrepresented to be only entertainers for the rich and upper class, but, in actuality, they were intelligent and extraordinarily skilled women, who can be compared to today's professionally-trained and educated women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women, after first democratic Korea was established, got increased opportunities to pursue education and engage in other economic activities. Now women are successful in every field: from business to law, and from science to architecture. But successful careers could also entail increased working hours. According to a report by OECD, on average, a South Korean person works about 38.9 hours a week, ranking the nation third among 37 countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased working hours lead to disinterest in dating or the inability to maintain existing relationships. A successful position in any industry for a woman comes with the fear of having to abandon it after her marriage. Marriage would mean the addition of another family (her in-laws) and the pressure of having a baby. Even if a working female decides to have a baby after her marriage, she would have to be away from her job for a while, which in turn would be a threat to the position she holds at her workplace. The work culture is very competitive in Korea and you can easily find replacements for any position. For a man to replace a woman is even easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage is not a union between two individuals but two families. This is even more appropriate for East Asian cultures, where, from marriage to childbearing, everything is linked. For a society bearing such thinking, it is only natural for a girl's parents to find an ideal groom for their daughter. An ideal son-in-law would be someone who can provide their daughter emotional and financial support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many women in Korea would not marry the man of their choice if their parents do not approve of him. Even if she decides to marry the guy her parents have chosen for her, she would still have to rely on her parents' financial help as marriages in Korea are very expensive. According to&amp;nbsp;Statista, in 2018 an average Korean wedding cost around 230 million Korean Won which includes&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Yedam&lt;/em&gt;, the gifts given to the groom's family. In a country where marriage comes with such a cost, it is only natural that a 21st-century South Korean woman finds having enough money in her bank account to own an apartment in&amp;nbsp;Gangnam&amp;nbsp;to be more attractive than getting married, even if it means that she has to work a few extra hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, with the growing popularity of Korean dramas which portray getting married to an older woman to be desirable, it is seen that the female population, when it does tie the knot, is also inclining towards getting married to men who are younger by five years and sometimes even ten years. This has led to increased growth in the number of remarriages, even though Korea's culture does not&amp;nbsp;favour&amp;nbsp;remarriage. In fact, given the increasing popularity of marriages with older women, changing trends can be seen with the subtle possibility of a matriarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all of this comes with a cost. Fertility in Korea has become not only an issue that concerns the people of the country but is also often talked about by various international news outlets. South Korea is known to have one of the lowest fertility rates in the world. The World Bank reports that women in South Korea have 1.2 children per capita (global average being 2.5 children). The problem, however, multiplies with the rapidly ageing population. The declining popularity of marriage among women has led to lessening birth rates in the country which indicates that there aren't enough babies being born to replace the older generations. This entails a high possibility of population decline. In fact, the UN reports that, by 2100, South Korea's population would reach as low as 29 million which is the same as the country's population in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea has been one of the flag bearers when it comes to exemplifying ideal romantic relationships to the consumers of television dramas but the reality is a bit different.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;government's effort to popularise dating and marriage to defend the country from a possible population decline includes introducing schemes and policies like providing one-off payment for each baby born to cover parental costs to turning off the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs' lights at 7 pm, once a month, with the hope that their employees would not be too tired to date and even have babies!&lt;/p&gt;

As these commodities are governed by the supreme forces of demand and supply, demand was close to nil due to the Central Government-imposed lockdown in India, which led the prices of commodities to fall to multi-year lows. Various prominent economists speculated about a slow-recovery, some predicted a short-term V-shaped recovery, but traders were sceptical as to what lay ahead of them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May, 2020, the prices of steel increased but were restricted to a paltry bracket of ₹3000 – ₹ 4000/- per tonne. The main reason for this were the high inventory levels maintained by the stockists as well as industrialists. Suppose, you have a warehouse and let’s suppose you’ve 100 tonnes of finished steel @ ₹35,000 per tonne, which means that unless you’re finished with 80% of your stock, you won’t order more. So essentially the prices won’t increase by a higher level, unless the stock is about to end. This is exactly what happened, and therefore, prices remained low.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the stock started to deplete at a tremendous rate, when India started to open up, owing to the pent-up demand, which led the traders to scramble for iron ore as well as finished steel, hence shooting up the prices. Iron-ore, the primary raw material of finished steel, was scantily available, due to most of the iron ores being closed because of the economic disruptions. Steadily, mines started operating, but it was a phased-opening. On the backdrop of a robust demand domestically, this furthered the upward pressure on the prices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, even China imported a record-high of 1.9 million tonnes during the first half of 2020-21. In contrast, in the same period of the previous year, China had merely imported 2,500 tonnes from India. This was essential because most of the Chinese steel firms use the blast furnace, which shouldn’t be turned off unless it is being shut down for the good. As the show must go on, China didn’t cease its infrastructure operations, rather it turned into an importer of India’s low grade iron ore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More intriguingly, this is the first time that India has turned into a net exporter of iron ore in a few years. India was literally exporting 69% of semi-finished steel and 28% of finished steel between April and August. Such heavy exporting activity exerted an even greater pressure on demand when the supply side was in shambles, making it another reason for the price growth from June to December 2020.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When things started to normalise in terms of easy availability of raw materials and demand scaled down to a normal level, stockists thought that prices would wane in the near future, but let’s wait and read!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned story is a classic case of a robust demand but scanty supply. But the story can’t be so straightforward: China has been the supremist steel player, not only in terms of production but also in terms of consumption. Therefore, any slow-down in the Chinese steel sector is reverberated all across the world. China, for quite some time, has been focusing on curbing pollution, and as steel mills heavily contribute to the pollution, there have been certain limitations to the production done by these ‘zombie enterprises.’&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This campaign was started by China in 2019, and though the emissions control goal wasn’t achieved in that year, the government has become stringent on production curbs since late 2020’s. Now, we can understand why India turned into a net exporter, because when there are production curbs in China, someone had to fulfil the demand, and hence India stepped in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about India, demand was really strong and on top of that, major steel producers were also exporting a lion’s share of their produce to China. When an investor thinks about all these macro and micro level developments, one can certainly understand that the steel players are going to be benefitted immensely by these developments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stock prices discount future earnings, they took a similar course of action this time as well. Major beneficiaries like JSW, SAIL, TATA STEEL, JSPL, to name a few have been on a bull run since November, 2020, and share prices have increased by up to 75%. Therefore, we can easily infer that the steel sector has been in for a rosy ride. But after a bright day, we certainly have a short gloomy period, and so did the steel industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steel prices had skyrocketed, and this caused a major impediment for the Chinese government to continue working on a plethora of infrastructure projects, and hence the administration stepped in. In the month of May, the Chinese Government intervened and started imposing heavy fines on people trying to hike up the prices. This made the investors lose confidence in the industry and the Iron Ore Futures fell north of 16% in a span of two weeks. Though this has proved to be a slight hiccup to the Indian steel Industry, with prices falling to about ₹4,000/- per tonne from the peak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But stalwarts of the industry are pretty optimistic about the Indian steel prices, because the current prices are still on discount, if compared with the global prices, and thereby provides some leeway for prices to increase.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What lies ahead of us is certainly hazy, like the current weather, but we can only sip our teas and hobble on our samosas, until China comes up with another development with regards to the steel industry.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Aditya Khandelwal</name></author><category term="business-finance" /><summary type="html">Last year in March 2020, when the world became afflicted by the new virus, traders dealing in commodities knew they were in for a difficult time.

China, for quite some time, has been focusing on curbing pollution, and as steel mills heavily contribute to the pollution, there have been certain limitations to the production done by these ‘zombie enterprises.’&amp;nbsp; This campaign was started by China in 2019, and though the emissions control goal wasn’t achieved in that year, the government has become stringent on production curbs since late 2020’s. Now, we can understand why India turned into a net exporter, because when there are production curbs in China, someone had to fulfil the demand, and hence India stepped in.&amp;nbsp; Talking about India, demand was really strong and on top of that, major steel producers were also exporting a lion’s share of their produce to China. When an investor thinks about all these macro and micro level developments, one can certainly understand that the steel players are going to be benefitted immensely by these developments.&amp;nbsp; As stock prices discount future earnings, they took a similar course of action this time as well. Major beneficiaries like JSW, SAIL, TATA STEEL, JSPL, to name a few have been on a bull run since November, 2020, and share prices have increased by up to 75%. Therefore, we can easily infer that the steel sector has been in for a rosy ride. But after a bright day, we certainly have a short gloomy period, and so did the steel industry. Steel prices had skyrocketed, and this caused a major impediment for the Chinese government to continue working on a plethora of infrastructure projects, and hence the administration stepped in. In the month of May, the Chinese Government intervened and started imposing heavy fines on people trying to hike up the prices. This made the investors lose confidence in the industry and the Iron Ore Futures fell north of 16% in a span of two weeks. Though this has proved to be a slight hiccup to the Indian steel Industry, with prices falling to about ₹4,000/- per tonne from the peak.&amp;nbsp; But stalwarts of the industry are pretty optimistic about the Indian steel prices, because the current prices are still on discount, if compared with the global prices, and thereby provides some leeway for prices to increase.&amp;nbsp; What lies ahead of us is certainly hazy, like the current weather, but we can only sip our teas and hobble on our samosas, until China comes up with another development with regards to the steel industry.&amp;nbsp;</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What is Your Ideal Brand Doing for Your ‘Pride’?</title><link href="/What-is-Your-Ideal-Brand-Doing-for-Your-Pride" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is Your Ideal Brand Doing for Your ‘Pride’?" /><published>2021-06-28T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2021-06-28T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>/What-is-Your-Ideal-Brand-Doing-for-Your-Pride</id><content type="html" xml:base="/What-is-Your-Ideal-Brand-Doing-for-Your-Pride">&lt;p&gt;Each year, in the summertime, Pride collections emerge like a swarm of vividly coloured locusts. They envelop every storefront and Instagram feed in June, promising solidarity for LGBTQ+ communities. In 2021, we are yet again observing the second virtual celebration of pride month. Numerous brands have leveraged pride marketing to increase visibility and lend support to others within the LGBTQ+ community who are still exploring their identities. However, brands tend to forget the existence of the community as soon as July rolls on. It makes us question, is this just another marketing gimmick?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is customary for Pride-themed merchandise to spike during June, a practice known as rainbow capitalism, is often criticised and compared to pinkwashing. Nevertheless, there is still tremendous value that can come from rocking rainbows during this time of the year. Like ‘empowerment campaigns’, several brands climb the trend wagon in Pride month, with no concern for the cause. Pride marketing is empathetic, where aiming ‘just for sales’ will misfire and attract more backlash from the audience and hurt the entity's image in the long term. Therefore, brands should not use Pride month to ramp up the sales but instead use their platform to show support and disperse awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Burger King's Pride month initiative was very thoughtful and won many hearts. Their tagline stated, &quot;&lt;em&gt;The pride is on you. The parade is on us&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, along with their delivery vehicles transformed. The campaign persisted till July 5. This year, diverse brands showcased their support to the community beyond rainbow washing and making the most out of pride marketing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular brands like Fossil, Apple, Reebok and others often dedicate enormous resources during Pride month to LGBTQ+ non-profit organisations (among them,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thetrevorproject.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Trevor Project&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glsen.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GLSEN&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and different groups), which means you could be helping others gain access to valuable resources, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To honour Pride month, Fossil launched its all-new limited-edition Pride collection to celebrate the spirit of love, equality and the very essence of individuality. The proceeds from this collection will benefit The Trevor Project — the world’s most significant suicide prevention and crisis intervention organisation for LGBTQ+ young adults.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Apple, it has released two new Apple Watch Pride bands this year and a new Pride watch face for users. The brand also supports many LGBTQ+ advocacy organisations, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://encircletogether.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Encircle&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(which offers safe spaces for LGBTQ+ youth, young adults and families), the&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://transequality.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;National Center for Transgender Equality&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(committed to social justice advocacy for transgender humans), and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add on, Reebok’s newest collection celebrating the LGBTQ+ community features a vibrant assortment of Pride-inspired footwear and apparel. The items were designed by Colorful Soles, the brand’s LGBTQ+ employee community, which also partnered with the legendary House of Ninja (spotlighted in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reviewed.com/streaming/features/black-history-documentaries-stream-now&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iconic documentary&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paris is Burning&lt;/em&gt;). Moreover, Reebok is donating $75,000 to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://srlp.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sylvia Rivera Law Project&lt;/a&gt;, which advocates for affirming access to social, health and legal services for persons of all gender identities and expressions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into the bargain, loads of fashion and beauty brands create Pride-inspired products that not only help you look great but also feel good as they support organisations that empower and uplift LGBTQ+ communities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give some instances, the Gap Collective Pride collection includes T-shirts, hoodies, socks and more for all ages. The brand is donating $50,000 this season to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.glaad.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD)&lt;/a&gt;, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levi's is flaunting the Pride collection &quot;All Pronouns. All Love&quot; by emphasising respect for people's pronouns. They have the inscribed phrase &quot;they/them, she/her, he/him, we&quot; on their collections, which is gender-neutral. It will be donating 100% of the profits to OutRight Action International.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NYX's limited-edition collection comprises a wide makeup range that will bring a colourful ultra-metallic sheen. It will also donate $100,000 to Pride efforts globally and contribute towards the LA LGBT Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other brands are also making their Pride-themed offerings and donations a year-round initiative, including Happy Socks, donating 10% of the sales from its rainbow-coloured socks to InterPride throughout the year, and Pink, which has expanded its offerings with its gender-inclusive Pink for All collection that debuted earlier this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next door, LEGO has launched a limited-edition&amp;nbsp;LGBTQ themed set. This is the first LGBTQ set with 11 monochromatic figures, each with an assigned colour and 346 pieces creating a rainbow cascade.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, TGI Fridays have introduced a decadent, delicious dessert. This dessert is six layers of rainbow-coloured vanilla cake piled high with vanilla icing and sprinkles and is available for home delivery and in-store locations. Part of the profits generated from the sales will be donated to support GLSEN&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many music platforms in India, like music streaming service Jio Saavan and Spotify, and music channel VH1 are also celebrating Pride Month.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other brands, Skittles took a bold move of launching limited-edition&amp;nbsp;Skittles Pride Packs&amp;nbsp;that come in grey packaging rather than rainbow washing. Even the candies inside are grey with delicious strawberries, orange, grape, apple, and lemon. For every pack sold, $1 will be donated to GLAAD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shira Kogan, Director of Corporate Development at The Trevor Project, said &lt;em&gt;&quot;We are thrilled to see so many companies and brands stepping up to support Pride this year.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; Well, it is true that brands have the power and platform to influence others. These brands can tell stories to empower the LGBTQ+ community through marketing campaigns or a separate product line. Together they can create a world where the LGBTQ+ community is championed, celebrated and protected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is that consumers of Pride gear are becoming more aware and are making an effort to shop where proceeds will make the most significant impact, including shopping at small, queer-owned businesses. For example, consumers are taking note when companies only feature underrepresented groups during their respective history or heritage months, says Ali Fazal, Vice President of Marketing at influencer marketing platform&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grin.co/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GRIN&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;&quot;(If) the only time they see LGBT people represented is during Pride Month, it's clear that what you're doing is not a long-term evolution for your company and your marketing.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; says Fazal.&lt;em&gt;&quot;You're just trying to capitalize upon the seasonality of that month.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let's be honest: Most major brands have not maintained a consistent enough relationship with LGBTQ+ communities to survive Pride month without some level of scrutiny. More often than not, ‘rainbow washing’ — that is, the act of deploying Pride-themed versions of their products and marketing it without substantially engaging queer communities — tends to be the minimal-effort route that multiple brands take and majority of consumers recognise these attempts as inauthentic almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's never too late to start developing real bonds with LGBTQ+ consumers. One of the most effective ways to show support is through charitable efforts, and Pride offers brands ample opportunities to turn their specialised products into the support that resonates beyond June.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a recent analysis, queer consumers who tend to maintain higher median household incomes, are more likely than other marginalised groups to actively seek and patronise the companies that engage with their collective community in a sustained fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, some brands understand the lasting power of giving back. It is important to remember the message one leaves out there can help lay the foundation of change. We need to understand that equality is not a once-a-month fight, but year-round support is necessary — not just for Pride month, but all the social causes we rise for. Together we can create a world, which is fairer for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Samakshi Garg</name></author><category term="trending" /><category term="business-finance" /><summary type="html">Each year, in the summertime, Pride collections emerge like a swarm of vividly coloured locusts.

Well, conflicts are an inevitable part of the survival of the human race; especially when existence is heterogeneous in nature. When conflicts intersect with political ideals and ideologies, land rights, religious dominance, etc they have the potential to churn out a war.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Time and time again, countries around the world have stepped down to avoid war but a few remain unlucky and suffer the aftermath. The cost of war is immeasurable for all the parties involved. No matter who wins the battle, the loss is suffered on all ends; and usually, it is equal in magnitude. Economics is well-stitched into a war, so much so that experts believe every war entails an economic motive irrespective of the reason presented to the public. This is probably why one will never come across two entities fighting for a barren land with no water sources, no mineral wealth and no means of attracting investment in any form. Even if the total area of such land can help the country expand its territorial boundaries, it is not worth a war!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;To lay the foundation it is important to understand the ‘war economy’. When a nation is in a state of war, the prioritisation principle witnesses a shift in expenditure. The production of goods and services that support war efforts and strengthen the defence front of the country assume importance. A country at war re-configures its budget and diverts all the taxes towards national security, the nation might also borrow to fund its requirements. One ramification of war is that it encourages innovation. War economies demonstrate more technological, industrial and medical advancements as they are in competition to create cheaper defence products along with the emergency medical units to be well prepared. This is an instance of infrastructural development. However, the focus is not the welfare of its citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;One might expect wealthy nations to be more violent as they have more to fight over. However, the econometric evidence is divided, most researches show that wealth reduces the probability of a civil war by manifolds. In addition, economic growth acts as a shield against violence, while recession increases the probability. The most common reason for this is that wealthier societies are able to better protect assets, thus making violence less attractive for would-be rebels. Another explanation, given by political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon argues that poverty causes violence, and points to cases where scarcity leads to migrations that result in conflicts between identity groups over resources. The cost of physical capital destruction and human capital destruction remain inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Do wars benefit anyone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;It will be paradoxical to state that war will benefit the country. A conflict that results in loss of human lives, destruction of property, trauma, leaving hundreds of people homeless, and the list goes on, cannot do good to anyone. However, economics rises a notch above human sentiments and reflects on the infrastructural developments and a shift in the demand-supply chain. A country that is in a state of war will accommodate its working population in order to work to the brim and achieve the fullest of its capacity, thus aiming at full employment across different sectors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Spike in employment, the surge in working capacity and inclusion of the latest technology to produce efficiently helps in boosting economic growth. The government invests in the latest technology in order to keep pace with the war which in turn boosts innovation in the territory and paves way for research and development (R&amp;amp;D).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Another important side effect of war is the change in social outlook and attitudes. History is evidence of the fact that women have stepped out of their houses in order to be a part of the labour force contributing to the battle whenever a war breaks out. Healthcare, a major support system during wars, witnesses women participating in large numbers to save the lives of soldiers. Various industries that work to boost the supplies welcome women in order to elevate the production capacity while the men go out to the battlefield. Women have played an important role in all the wars that humanity has witnessed till now, so much so that they became aware of their rights after World War I and World War II and with a stride of independence they continued to voice their rights and soon the demand for ‘vote’ was raised by women across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is at stake for Israel-Palestine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;In May 2021, Israel and Pakistan counted 11 days of hostilities that resulted in the loss of life and physical capital on both ends. The housing ministry of Gaza stated that 16,800 housing units have been damaged. The electricity grids across Gaza remain dismantled with barely three-four hours of power supply in a day. The Hamas media office estimated the bombardments had caused $40 million in damage to factories and the strip’s industrial zone and other industrial facilities, in addition to $22 million in damage to the energy sector. In addition, the sanitation facilities have been damaged and the water supply remains disrupted with limited or no access to water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The Israeli economy already contracted by 6.5% in the first quarter due to the pandemic.&amp;nbsp; The Central Bureau of Statistics predicts that the road to revival is likely to stay disrupted owing to the fight between Israel and Palestine. Israel’s manufacturers’ association reported a loss of $166 million as of 13 May 2021 because the south and centre of the country witnessed intense rocket fire from Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;The economic relations between Israel and Palestine date back to 1967 when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip and integrated their markets with its own. The Israeli economy was about ten times the size of its neighbour’s economy and the manufacturing sector’s GDP share was over four times larger. Thus the difference was between a large, rich and advanced economy and a small, poor and underdeveloped economy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Both theoretical analysis and empirical studies suggest that the dynamics of such a relationship always generates two opposing forces that disproportionately affect the smaller economy and shape its development. A favourable repercussion is an increased demand for the products of the small economy, diffusion of technology and knowledge. Unfavourable repercussions arise from the disappearance of many industries in the small economy, its confinement to producing low-skill goods, and the emigration of a sizable segment of its labour force to the neighbouring economy, as well as to other countries. This suppression of a powerful neighbour has resulted in numerous incidents of violence, time and again. The end consequence has been that the region of Palestine has seen practically no development and has remained war torn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;ql-align-justify&quot;&gt;Nevertheless, “who benefits from war?” remains unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vanshika Sighroha</name></author><category term="economics" /><summary type="html">What gives rise to wars?

The Hamas media office estimated the bombardments had caused $40 million in damage to factories and the strip’s industrial zone and other industrial facilities, in addition to $22 million in damage to the energy sector. In addition, the sanitation facilities have been damaged and the water supply remains disrupted with limited or no access to water. The Israeli economy already contracted by 6.5% in the first quarter due to the pandemic.&amp;nbsp; The Central Bureau of Statistics predicts that the road to revival is likely to stay disrupted owing to the fight between Israel and Palestine. Israel’s manufacturers’ association reported a loss of $166 million as of 13 May 2021 because the south and centre of the country witnessed intense rocket fire from Gaza. The economic relations between Israel and Palestine date back to 1967 when Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip and integrated their markets with its own. The Israeli economy was about ten times the size of its neighbour’s economy and the manufacturing sector’s GDP share was over four times larger. Thus the difference was between a large, rich and advanced economy and a small, poor and underdeveloped economy.&amp;nbsp; Both theoretical analysis and empirical studies suggest that the dynamics of such a relationship always generates two opposing forces that disproportionately affect the smaller economy and shape its development. A favourable repercussion is an increased demand for the products of the small economy, diffusion of technology and knowledge. Unfavourable repercussions arise from the disappearance of many industries in the small economy, its confinement to producing low-skill goods, and the emigration of a sizable segment of its labour force to the neighbouring economy, as well as to other countries. This suppression of a powerful neighbour has resulted in numerous incidents of violence, time and again. The end consequence has been that the region of Palestine has seen practically no development and has remained war torn.&amp;nbsp; Nevertheless, “who benefits from war?” remains unanswered.</summary></entry></feed>
