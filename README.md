# The Pangean
### About us:

The Pangean is a newspaper that seeks to herald a revolution in media. It has no ideological persuasion in the articles it puts forth, welcoming diverse opinions on all kinds of subjects. The aim of The Pangean is to take a step back from all of the noise of the current social, cultural and political discourse and to examine real issues in a calm, balanced and nuanced way. The Pangean is a life affirming organisation that always seeks to infuse in the lives of our readers’ a sense of wisdom and happiness.
